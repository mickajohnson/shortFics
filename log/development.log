The old banker was walking up and down his study and remembering how, fifteen years before, he had given a party one autumn evening. There had been many clever men there, and there had been interesting conversations. Among other things they had talked of capital punishment. The majority of the guests, among whom were many journalists and intellectual men, disapproved of the death penalty. They considered that form of punishment out of date, immoral, and unsuitable for Christian States. In the opinion of some of them the death penalty ought to be replaced everywhere by imprisonment for life.\n“I don’t agree with you,” said their host the banker. “I have not tried either the death penalty or imprisonment for life, but if one may judge a priori, the death penalty is more moral and more humane than imprisonment for life. Capital punishment kills a man at once, but lifelong imprisonment kills him slowly. Which executioner is the more humane, he who kills you in a few minutes or he who drags the life out of you in the course of many years?”\n“Both are equally immoral,” observed one of the guests, “for they both have the same object—to take away life. The State is not God. It has not the right to take away what it cannot restore when it wants to.”\nAmong the guests was a young lawyer, a young man of five-and-twenty. When he was asked his opinion, he said:\n“The death sentence and the life sentence are equally immoral, but if I had to choose between the death penalty and imprisonment for life, I would certainly choose the second. To live anyhow is better than not at all.”\nA lively discussion arose. The banker, who was younger and more nervous in those days, was suddenly carried away by excitement; he struck the table with his fist and shouted at the young man:\n“It’s not true! I’ll bet you two millions you wouldn’t stay in solitary confinement for five years.”\n“If you mean that in earnest,” said the young man, “I’ll take the bet, but I would stay not five but fifteen years.”\n“Fifteen? Done!” cried the banker. “Gentlemen, I stake two millions!”\n“Agreed! You stake your millions and I stake my freedom!” said the young man.\nAnd this wild, senseless bet was carried out! The banker, spoilt and frivolous, with millions beyond his reckoning, was delighted at the bet. At supper he made fun of the young man, and said:\n“Think better of it, young man, while there is still time. To me two millions are a trifle, but you are losing three or four of the best years of your life. I say three or four, because you won’t stay longer. Don’t forget either, you unhappy man, that voluntary confinement is a great deal harder to bear than compulsory. The thought that you have the right to step out in liberty at any moment will poison your whole existence in prison. I am sorry for you.”\nAnd now the banker, walking to and fro, remembered all this, and asked himself: “What was the object of that bet? What is the good of that man’s losing fifteen years of his life and my throwing away two millions? Can it prove that the death penalty is better or worse than imprisonment for life? No, no. It was all nonsensical and meaningless. On my part it was the caprice of a pampered man, and on his part simple greed for money....”\nThen he remembered what followed that evening. It was decided that the young man should spend the years of his captivity under the strictest supervision in one of the lodges in the banker’s garden. It was agreed that for fifteen years he should not be free to cross the threshold of the lodge, to see human beings, to hear the human voice, or to receive letters and newspapers. He was allowed to have a musical instrument and books, and was allowed to write letters, to drink wine, and to smoke. By the terms of the agreement, the only relations he could have with the outer world were by a little window made purposely for that object. He might have anything he wanted—books, music, wine, and so on—in any quantity he desired by writing an order, but could only receive them through the window. The agreement provided for every detail and every trifle that would make his imprisonment strictly solitary, and bound the young man to stay there exactly fifteen years, beginning from twelve o’clock of November 14, 1870, and ending at twelve o’clock of November 14, 1885. The slightest attempt on his part to break the conditions, if only two minutes before the end, released the banker from the obligation to pay him two millions.\nFor the first year of his confinement, as far as one could judge from his brief notes, the prisoner suffered severely from loneliness and depression. The sounds of the piano could be heard continually day and night from his lodge. He refused wine and tobacco. Wine, he wrote, excites the desires, and desires are the worst foes of the prisoner; and besides, nothing could be more dreary than drinking good wine and seeing no one. And tobacco spoilt the air of his room. In the first year the books he sent for were principally of a light character; novels with a complicated love plot, sensational and fantastic stories, and so on.\nIn the second year the piano was silent in the lodge, and the prisoner asked only for the classics. In the fifth year music was audible again, and the prisoner asked for wine. Those who watched him through the window said that all that year he spent doing nothing but eating and drinking and lying on his bed, frequently yawning and angrily talking to himself. He did not read books. Sometimes at night he would sit down to write; he would spend hours writing, and in the morning tear up all that he had written. More than once he could be heard crying.\nIn the second half of the sixth year the prisoner began zealously studying languages, philosophy, and history. He threw himself eagerly into these studies—so much so that the banker had enough to do to get him the books he ordered. In the course of four years some six hundred volumes were procured at his request. It was during this period that the banker received the following letter from his prisoner:\n“My dear Jailer, I write you these lines in six languages. Show them to people who know the languages. Let them read them. If they find not one mistake I implore you to fire a shot in the garden. That shot will show me that my efforts have not been thrown away. The geniuses of all ages and of all lands speak different languages, but the same flame burns in them all. Oh, if you only knew what unearthly happiness my soul feels now from being able to understand them!” The prisoner’s desire was fulfilled. The banker ordered two shots to be fired in the garden.\nThen after the tenth year, the prisoner sat immovably at the table and read nothing but the Gospel. It seemed strange to the banker that a man who in four years had mastered six hundred learned volumes should waste nearly a year over one thin book easy of comprehension. Theology and histories of religion followed the Gospels.\nIn the last two years of his confinement the prisoner read an immense quantity of books quite indiscriminately. At one time he was busy with the natural sciences, then he would ask for Byron or Shakespeare. There were notes in which he demanded at the same time books on chemistry, and a manual of medicine, and a novel, and some treatise on philosophy or theology. His reading suggested a man swimming in the sea among the wreckage of his ship, and trying to save his life by greedily clutching first at one spar and then at another.\n\nII\nThe old banker remembered all this, and thought:\n“To-morrow at twelve o’clock he will regain his freedom. By our agreement I ought to pay him two millions. If I do pay him, it is all over with me: I shall be utterly ruined.”\nFifteen years before, his millions had been beyond his reckoning; now he was afraid to ask himself which were greater, his debts or his assets. Desperate gambling on the Stock Exchange, wild speculation and the excitability which he could not get over even in advancing years, had by degrees led to the decline of his fortune and the proud, fearless, self-confident millionaire had become a banker of middling rank, trembling at every rise and fall in his investments. “Cursed bet!” muttered the old man, clutching his head in despair. “Why didn’t the man die? He is only forty now. He will take my last penny from me, he will marry, will enjoy life, will gamble on the Exchange; while I shall look at him with envy like a beggar, and hear from him every day the same sentence: ‘I am indebted to you for the happiness of my life, let me help you!’ No, it is too much! The one means of being saved from bankruptcy and disgrace is the death of that man!”\nIt struck three o’clock, the banker listened; everyone was asleep in the house and nothing could be heard outside but the rustling of the chilled trees. Trying to make no noise, he took from a fireproof safe the key of the door which had not been opened for fifteen years, put on his overcoat, and went out of the house.\nIt was dark and cold in the garden. Rain was falling. A damp cutting wind was racing about the garden, howling and giving the trees no rest. The banker strained his eyes, but could see neither the earth nor the white statues, nor the lodge, nor the trees. Going to the spot where the lodge stood, he twice called the watchman. No answer followed. Evidently the watchman had sought shelter from the weather, and was now asleep somewhere either in the kitchen or in the greenhouse.\n“If I had the pluck to carry out my intention,” thought the old man, “suspicion would fall first upon the watchman.”\nHe felt in the darkness for the steps and the door, and went into the entry of the lodge. Then he groped his way into a little passage and lighted a match. There was not a soul there. There was a bedstead with no bedding on it, and in the corner there was a dark cast-iron stove. The seals on the door leading to the prisoner’s rooms were intact.\nWhen the match went out the old man, trembling with emotion, peeped through the little window. A candle was burning dimly in the prisoner’s room. He was sitting at the table. Nothing could be seen but his back, the hair on his head, and his hands. Open books were lying on the table, on the two easy-chairs, and on the carpet near the table.\nFive minutes passed and the prisoner did not once stir. Fifteen years’ imprisonment had taught him to sit still. The banker tapped at the window with his finger, and the prisoner made no movement whatever in response. Then the banker cautiously broke the seals off the door and put the key in the keyhole. The rusty lock gave a grating sound and the door creaked. The banker expected to hear at once footsteps and a cry of astonishment, but three minutes passed and it was as quiet as ever in the room. He made up his mind to go in.\nAt the table a man unlike ordinary people was sitting motionless. He was a skeleton with the skin drawn tight over his bones, with long curls like a woman’s and a shaggy beard. His face was yellow with an earthy tint in it, his cheeks were hollow, his back long and narrow, and the hand on which his shaggy head was propped was so thin and delicate that it was dreadful to look at it. His hair was already streaked with silver, and seeing his emaciated, aged-looking face, no one would have believed that he was only forty. He was asleep.... In front of his bowed head there lay on the table a sheet of paper on which there was something written in fine handwriting.\n“Poor creature!” thought the banker, “he is asleep and most likely dreaming of the millions. And I have only to take this half-dead man, throw him on the bed, stifle him a little with the pillow, and the most conscientious expert would find no sign of a violent death. But let us first read what he has written here....”\nThe banker took the page from the table and read as follows:\n“To-morrow at twelve o’clock I regain my freedom and the right to associate with other men, but before I leave this room and see the sunshine, I think it necessary to say a few words to you. With a clear conscience I tell you, as before God, who beholds me, that I despise freedom and life and health, and all that in your books is called the good things of the world.\n“For fifteen years I have been intently studying earthly life. It is true I have not seen the earth nor men, but in your books I have drunk fragrant wine, I have sung songs, I have hunted stags and wild boars in the forests, have loved women.... Beauties as ethereal as clouds, created by the magic of your poets and geniuses, have visited me at night, and have whispered in my ears wonderful tales that have set my brain in a whirl. In your books I have climbed to the peaks of Elburz and Mont Blanc, and from there I have seen the sun rise and have watched it at evening flood the sky, the ocean, and the mountain-tops with gold and crimson. I have watched from there the lightning flashing over my head and cleaving the storm-clouds. I have seen green forests, fields, rivers, lakes, towns. I have heard the singing of the sirens, and the strains of the shepherds’ pipes; I have touched the wings of comely devils who flew down to converse with me of God.... In your books I have flung myself into the bottomless pit, performed miracles, slain, burned towns, preached new religions, conquered whole kingdoms....\n“Your books have given me wisdom. All that the unresting thought of man has created in the ages is compressed into a small compass in my brain. I know that I am wiser than all of you.\n“And I despise your books, I despise wisdom and the blessings of this world. It is all worthless, fleeting, illusory, and deceptive, like a mirage. You may be proud, wise, and fine, but death will wipe you off the face of the earth as though you were no more than mice burrowing under the floor, and your posterity, your history, your immortal geniuses will burn or freeze together with the earthly globe.\n“You have lost your reason and taken the wrong path. You have taken lies for truth, and hideousness for beauty. You would marvel if, owing to strange events of some sorts, frogs and lizards suddenly grew on apple and orange trees instead of fruit, or if roses began to smell like a sweating horse; so I marvel at you who exchange heaven for earth. I don’t want to understand you.\n“To prove to you in action how I despise all that you live by, I renounce the two millions of which I once dreamed as of paradise and which now I despise. To deprive myself of the right to the money I shall go out from here five hours before the time fixed, and so break the compact....”\nWhen the banker had read this he laid the page on the table, kissed the strange man on the head, and went out of the lodge, weeping. At no other time, even when he had lost heavily on the Stock Exchange, had he felt so great a contempt for himself. When he got home he lay on his bed, but his tears and emotion kept him for hours from sleeping.\nNext morning the watchmen ran in with pale faces, and told him they had seen the man who lived in the lodge climb out of the window into the garden, go to the gate, and disappear. The banker went at once with the servants to the lodge and made sure of the flight of his prisoner. To avoid arousing unnecessary talk, he took from the table the writing in which the millions were renounced, and when he got home locked it up in the fireproof safe."], ["snippet", "It was a dark autumn night. The old banker was walking up and down his study and remembering how, fifteen years before, he had given a party one autumn evening. There had been many clever men there, and there had been interesting conversations. Among other things they had talked of capital punishment. The majority of the guests, among whom were many journalists and intellectual men, disapproved of the death penalty. They considered that form of punishment out of date, immoral, and unsuitable for Christian States. In the opinion of some of them the death penalty ought to be replaced everywhere by imprisonment for life.\n“I don’t agree with you,” said their host the banker. “I have not tried either the death penalty or imprisonment for life, but if one may judge a priori, the death penalty is more moral and more humane than imprisonment for life. Capital punishment kills a man at once, but lifelong imprisonment kills him slowly. Which executioner is the more humane, he who kills you in a few minutes or he who drags the life out of you in the course of many years?”\n“Both are equally immoral,” observed one of the guests, “for they both have the same object—to take away life. The State is not God. It has not the right to take away what it cannot restore when it wants to.”\nAmong the guests was a young lawyer, a young man of five-and-twenty."], ["created_at", 2017-04-01 20:10:15 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-04-01 20:10:15 UTC], ["genre_id", 1]]

The old banker was walking up and down his study and remembering how, fifteen years before, he had given a party one autumn evening. There had been many clever men there, and there had been interesting conversations. Among other things they had talked of capital punishment. The majority of the guests, among whom were many journalists and intellectual men, disapproved of the death penalty. They considered that form of punishment out of date, immoral, and unsuitable for Christian States. In the opinion of some of them the death penalty ought to be replaced everywhere by imprisonment for life.\n“I don’t agree with you,” said their host the banker. “I have not tried either the death penalty or imprisonment for life, but if one may judge a priori, the death penalty is more moral and more humane than imprisonment for life. Capital punishment kills a man at once, but lifelong imprisonment kills him slowly. Which executioner is the more humane, he who kills you in a few minutes or he who drags the life out of you in the course of many years?”\n“Both are equally immoral,” observed one of the guests, “for they both have the same object—to take away life. The State is not God. It has not the right to take away what it cannot restore when it wants to.”\nAmong the guests was a young lawyer, a young man of five-and-twenty. When he was asked his opinion, he said:\n“The death sentence and the life sentence are equally immoral, but if I had to choose between the death penalty and imprisonment for life, I would certainly choose the second. To live anyhow is better than not at all.”\nA lively discussion arose. The banker, who was younger and more nervous in those days, was suddenly carried away by excitement; he struck the table with his fist and shouted at the young man:\n“It’s not true! I’ll bet you two millions you wouldn’t stay in solitary confinement for five years.”\n“If you mean that in earnest,” said the young man, “I’ll take the bet, but I would stay not five but fifteen years.”\n“Fifteen? Done!” cried the banker. “Gentlemen, I stake two millions!”\n“Agreed! You stake your millions and I stake my freedom!” said the young man.\nAnd this wild, senseless bet was carried out! The banker, spoilt and frivolous, with millions beyond his reckoning, was delighted at the bet. At supper he made fun of the young man, and said:\n“Think better of it, young man, while there is still time. To me two millions are a trifle, but you are losing three or four of the best years of your life. I say three or four, because you won’t stay longer. Don’t forget either, you unhappy man, that voluntary confinement is a great deal harder to bear than compulsory. The thought that you have the right to step out in liberty at any moment will poison your whole existence in prison. I am sorry for you.”\nAnd now the banker, walking to and fro, remembered all this, and asked himself: “What was the object of that bet? What is the good of that man’s losing fifteen years of his life and my throwing away two millions? Can it prove that the death penalty is better or worse than imprisonment for life? No, no. It was all nonsensical and meaningless. On my part it was the caprice of a pampered man, and on his part simple greed for money....”\nThen he remembered what followed that evening. It was decided that the young man should spend the years of his captivity under the strictest supervision in one of the lodges in the banker’s garden. It was agreed that for fifteen years he should not be free to cross the threshold of the lodge, to see human beings, to hear the human voice, or to receive letters and newspapers. He was allowed to have a musical instrument and books, and was allowed to write letters, to drink wine, and to smoke. By the terms of the agreement, the only relations he could have with the outer world were by a little window made purposely for that object. He might have anything he wanted—books, music, wine, and so on—in any quantity he desired by writing an order, but could only receive them through the window. The agreement provided for every detail and every trifle that would make his imprisonment strictly solitary, and bound the young man to stay there exactly fifteen years, beginning from twelve o’clock of November 14, 1870, and ending at twelve o’clock of November 14, 1885. The slightest attempt on his part to break the conditions, if only two minutes before the end, released the banker from the obligation to pay him two millions.\nFor the first year of his confinement, as far as one could judge from his brief notes, the prisoner suffered severely from loneliness and depression. The sounds of the piano could be heard continually day and night from his lodge. He refused wine and tobacco. Wine, he wrote, excites the desires, and desires are the worst foes of the prisoner; and besides, nothing could be more dreary than drinking good wine and seeing no one. And tobacco spoilt the air of his room. In the first year the books he sent for were principally of a light character; novels with a complicated love plot, sensational and fantastic stories, and so on.\nIn the second year the piano was silent in the lodge, and the prisoner asked only for the classics. In the fifth year music was audible again, and the prisoner asked for wine. Those who watched him through the window said that all that year he spent doing nothing but eating and drinking and lying on his bed, frequently yawning and angrily talking to himself. He did not read books. Sometimes at night he would sit down to write; he would spend hours writing, and in the morning tear up all that he had written. More than once he could be heard crying.\nIn the second half of the sixth year the prisoner began zealously studying languages, philosophy, and history. He threw himself eagerly into these studies—so much so that the banker had enough to do to get him the books he ordered. In the course of four years some six hundred volumes were procured at his request. It was during this period that the banker received the following letter from his prisoner:\n“My dear Jailer, I write you these lines in six languages. Show them to people who know the languages. Let them read them. If they find not one mistake I implore you to fire a shot in the garden. That shot will show me that my efforts have not been thrown away. The geniuses of all ages and of all lands speak different languages, but the same flame burns in them all. Oh, if you only knew what unearthly happiness my soul feels now from being able to understand them!” The prisoner’s desire was fulfilled. The banker ordered two shots to be fired in the garden.\nThen after the tenth year, the prisoner sat immovably at the table and read nothing but the Gospel. It seemed strange to the banker that a man who in four years had mastered six hundred learned volumes should waste nearly a year over one thin book easy of comprehension. Theology and histories of religion followed the Gospels.\nIn the last two years of his confinement the prisoner read an immense quantity of books quite indiscriminately. At one time he was busy with the natural sciences, then he would ask for Byron or Shakespeare. There were notes in which he demanded at the same time books on chemistry, and a manual of medicine, and a novel, and some treatise on philosophy or theology. His reading suggested a man swimming in the sea among the wreckage of his ship, and trying to save his life by greedily clutching first at one spar and then at another.\n\nII\nThe old banker remembered all this, and thought:\n“To-morrow at twelve o’clock he will regain his freedom. By our agreement I ought to pay him two millions. If I do pay him, it is all over with me: I shall be utterly ruined.”\nFifteen years before, his millions had been beyond his reckoning; now he was afraid to ask himself which were greater, his debts or his assets. Desperate gambling on the Stock Exchange, wild speculation and the excitability which he could not get over even in advancing years, had by degrees led to the decline of his fortune and the proud, fearless, self-confident millionaire had become a banker of middling rank, trembling at every rise and fall in his investments. “Cursed bet!” muttered the old man, clutching his head in despair. “Why didn’t the man die? He is only forty now. He will take my last penny from me, he will marry, will enjoy life, will gamble on the Exchange; while I shall look at him with envy like a beggar, and hear from him every day the same sentence: ‘I am indebted to you for the happiness of my life, let me help you!’ No, it is too much! The one means of being saved from bankruptcy and disgrace is the death of that man!”\nIt struck three o’clock, the banker listened; everyone was asleep in the house and nothing could be heard outside but the rustling of the chilled trees. Trying to make no noise, he took from a fireproof safe the key of the door which had not been opened for fifteen years, put on his overcoat, and went out of the house.\nIt was dark and cold in the garden. Rain was falling. A damp cutting wind was racing about the garden, howling and giving the trees no rest. The banker strained his eyes, but could see neither the earth nor the white statues, nor the lodge, nor the trees. Going to the spot where the lodge stood, he twice called the watchman. No answer followed. Evidently the watchman had sought shelter from the weather, and was now asleep somewhere either in the kitchen or in the greenhouse.\n“If I had the pluck to carry out my intention,” thought the old man, “suspicion would fall first upon the watchman.”\nHe felt in the darkness for the steps and the door, and went into the entry of the lodge. Then he groped his way into a little passage and lighted a match. There was not a soul there. There was a bedstead with no bedding on it, and in the corner there was a dark cast-iron stove. The seals on the door leading to the prisoner’s rooms were intact.\nWhen the match went out the old man, trembling with emotion, peeped through the little window. A candle was burning dimly in the prisoner’s room. He was sitting at the table. Nothing could be seen but his back, the hair on his head, and his hands. Open books were lying on the table, on the two easy-chairs, and on the carpet near the table.\nFive minutes passed and the prisoner did not once stir. Fifteen years’ imprisonment had taught him to sit still. The banker tapped at the window with his finger, and the prisoner made no movement whatever in response. Then the banker cautiously broke the seals off the door and put the key in the keyhole. The rusty lock gave a grating sound and the door creaked. The banker expected to hear at once footsteps and a cry of astonishment, but three minutes passed and it was as quiet as ever in the room. He made up his mind to go in.\nAt the table a man unlike ordinary people was sitting motionless. He was a skeleton with the skin drawn tight over his bones, with long curls like a woman’s and a shaggy beard. His face was yellow with an earthy tint in it, his cheeks were hollow, his back long and narrow, and the hand on which his shaggy head was propped was so thin and delicate that it was dreadful to look at it. His hair was already streaked with silver, and seeing his emaciated, aged-looking face, no one would have believed that he was only forty. He was asleep.... In front of his bowed head there lay on the table a sheet of paper on which there was something written in fine handwriting.\n“Poor creature!” thought the banker, “he is asleep and most likely dreaming of the millions. And I have only to take this half-dead man, throw him on the bed, stifle him a little with the pillow, and the most conscientious expert would find no sign of a violent death. But let us first read what he has written here....”\nThe banker took the page from the table and read as follows:\n“To-morrow at twelve o’clock I regain my freedom and the right to associate with other men, but before I leave this room and see the sunshine, I think it necessary to say a few words to you. With a clear conscience I tell you, as before God, who beholds me, that I despise freedom and life and health, and all that in your books is called the good things of the world.\n“For fifteen years I have been intently studying earthly life. It is true I have not seen the earth nor men, but in your books I have drunk fragrant wine, I have sung songs, I have hunted stags and wild boars in the forests, have loved women.... Beauties as ethereal as clouds, created by the magic of your poets and geniuses, have visited me at night, and have whispered in my ears wonderful tales that have set my brain in a whirl. In your books I have climbed to the peaks of Elburz and Mont Blanc, and from there I have seen the sun rise and have watched it at evening flood the sky, the ocean, and the mountain-tops with gold and crimson. I have watched from there the lightning flashing over my head and cleaving the storm-clouds. I have seen green forests, fields, rivers, lakes, towns. I have heard the singing of the sirens, and the strains of the shepherds’ pipes; I have touched the wings of comely devils who flew down to converse with me of God.... In your books I have flung myself into the bottomless pit, performed miracles, slain, burned towns, preached new religions, conquered whole kingdoms....\n“Your books have given me wisdom. All that the unresting thought of man has created in the ages is compressed into a small compass in my brain. I know that I am wiser than all of you.\n“And I despise your books, I despise wisdom and the blessings of this world. It is all worthless, fleeting, illusory, and deceptive, like a mirage. You may be proud, wise, and fine, but death will wipe you off the face of the earth as though you were no more than mice burrowing under the floor, and your posterity, your history, your immortal geniuses will burn or freeze together with the earthly globe.\n“You have lost your reason and taken the wrong path. You have taken lies for truth, and hideousness for beauty. You would marvel if, owing to strange events of some sorts, frogs and lizards suddenly grew on apple and orange trees instead of fruit, or if roses began to smell like a sweating horse; so I marvel at you who exchange heaven for earth. I don’t want to understand you.\n“To prove to you in action how I despise all that you live by, I renounce the two millions of which I once dreamed as of paradise and which now I despise. To deprive myself of the right to the money I shall go out from here five hours before the time fixed, and so break the compact....”\nWhen the banker had read this he laid the page on the table, kissed the strange man on the head, and went out of the lodge, weeping. At no other time, even when he had lost heavily on the Stock Exchange, had he felt so great a contempt for himself. When he got home he lay on his bed, but his tears and emotion kept him for hours from sleeping.\nNext morning the watchmen ran in with pale faces, and told him they had seen the man who lived in the lodge climb out of the window into the garden, go to the gate, and disappear. The banker went at once with the servants to the lodge and made sure of the flight of his prisoner. To avoid arousing unnecessary talk, he took from the table the writing in which the millions were renounced, and when he got home locked it up in the fireproof safe.\n"], ["snippet", "It was a dark autumn night.

Her head was leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired.\n\nFew people passed. The man out of the last house passed on his way home; she heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses. One time there used to be a field there in which they used to play every evening with other people’s children. Then a man from Belfast bought the field and built houses in it—not like their little brown houses but bright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the avenue used to play together in that field—the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns, little Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters. Ernest, however, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to hunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually little Keogh used to keep nix and call out when he saw her father coming. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was not so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. That was a long time ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up; her mother was dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to England. Everything changes. Now she was going to go away like the others, to leave her home.\n\nHome! She looked round the room, reviewing all its familiar objects which she had dusted once a week for so many years, wondering where on earth all the dust came from. Perhaps she would never see again those familiar objects from which she had never dreamed of being divided. And yet during all those years she had never found out the name of the priest whose yellowing photograph hung on the wall above the broken harmonium beside the coloured print of the promises made to Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque. He had been a school friend of her father. Whenever he showed the photograph to a visitor her father used to pass it with a casual word:\n\n“He is in Melbourne now.”\n\nShe had consented to go away, to leave her home. Was that wise? She tried to weigh each side of the question. In her home anyway she had shelter and food; she had those whom she had known all her life about her. Of course she had to work hard, both in the house and at business. What would they say of her in the Stores when they found out that she had run away with a fellow? Say she was a fool, perhaps; and her place would be filled up by advertisement. Miss Gavan would be glad. She had always had an edge on her, especially whenever there were people listening.\n\n“Miss Hill, don’t you see these ladies are waiting?”\n\n“Look lively, Miss Hill, please.”\n\nShe would not cry many tears at leaving the Stores.\n\nBut in her new home, in a distant unknown country, it would not be like that. Then she would be married—she, Eveline. People would treat her with respect then. She would not be treated as her mother had been. Even now, though she was over nineteen, she sometimes felt herself in danger of her father’s violence. She knew it was that that had given her the palpitations. When they were growing up he had never gone for her like he used to go for Harry and Ernest, because she was a girl; but latterly he had begun to threaten her and say what he would do to her only for her dead mother’s sake. And now she had nobody to protect her. Ernest was dead and Harry, who was in the church decorating business, was nearly always down somewhere in the country. Besides, the invariable squabble for money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her unspeakably. She always gave her entire wages—seven shillings—and Harry always sent up what he could but the trouble was to get any money from her father. He said she used to squander the money, that she had no head, that he wasn’t going to give her his hard-earned money to throw about the streets, and much more, for he was usually fairly bad of a Saturday night. In the end he would give her the money and ask her had she any intention of buying Sunday’s dinner. Then she had to rush out as quickly as she could and do her marketing, holding her black leather purse tightly in her hand as she elbowed her way through the crowds and returning home late under her load of provisions. She had hard work to keep the house together and to see that the two young children who had been left to her charge went to school regularly and got their meals regularly. It was hard work—a hard life—but now that she was about to leave it she did not find it a wholly undesirable life.\n\nShe was about to explore another life with Frank. Frank was very kind, manly, open-hearted. She was to go away with him by the night-boat to be his wife and to live with him in Buenos Ayres where he had a home waiting for her. How well she remembered the first time she had seen him; he was lodging in a house on the main road where she used to visit. It seemed a few weeks ago. He was standing at the gate, his peaked cap pushed back on his head and his hair tumbled forward over a face of bronze. Then they had come to know each other. He used to meet her outside the Stores every evening and see her home. He took her to see The Bohemian Girl and she felt elated as she sat in an unaccustomed part of the theatre with him. He was awfully fond of music and sang a little. People knew that they were courting and, when he sang about the lass that loves a sailor, she always felt pleasantly confused. He used to call her Poppens out of fun. First of all it had been an excitement for her to have a fellow and then she had begun to like him. He had tales of distant countries. He had started as a deck boy at a pound a month on a ship of the Allan Line going out to Canada. He told her the names of the ships he had been on and the names of the different services. He had sailed through the Straits of Magellan and he told her stories of the terrible Patagonians. He had fallen on his feet in Buenos Ayres, he said, and had come over to the old country just for a holiday. Of course, her father had found out the affair and had forbidden her to have anything to say to him.\n\n“I know these sailor chaps,” he said.\n\nOne day he had quarrelled with Frank and after that she had to meet her lover secretly.\n\nThe evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two letters in her lap grew indistinct. One was to Harry; the other was to her father. Ernest had been her favourite but she liked Harry too. Her father was becoming old lately, she noticed; he would miss her. Sometimes he could be very nice. Not long before, when she had been laid up for a day, he had read her out a ghost story and made toast for her at the fire. Another day, when their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to the Hill of Howth. She remembered her father putting on her mother’s bonnet to make the children laugh.\n\nHer time was running out but she continued to sit by the window, leaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling the odour of dusty cretonne. Down far in the avenue she could hear a street organ playing. She knew the air. Strange that it should come that very night to remind her of the promise to her mother, her promise to keep the home together as long as she could. She remembered the last night of her mother’s illness; she was again in the close dark room at the other side of the hall and outside she heard a melancholy air of Italy. The organ-player had been ordered to go away and given sixpence. She remembered her father strutting back into the sickroom saying:\n\n“Damned Italians! coming over here!”\n\nAs she mused the pitiful vision of her mother’s life laid its spell on the very quick of her being—that life of commonplace sacrifices closing in final craziness. She trembled as she heard again her mother’s voice saying constantly with foolish insistence:\n\n“Derevaun Seraun! Derevaun Seraun!”\n\nShe stood up in a sudden impulse of terror. Escape! She must escape! Frank would save her. He would give her life, perhaps love, too. But she wanted to live. Why should she be unhappy? She had a right to happiness. Frank would take her in his arms, fold her in his arms. He would save her.\n\n\n\nShe stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the North Wall. He held her hand and she knew that he was speaking to her, saying something about the passage over and over again. The station was full of soldiers with brown baggages. Through the wide doors of the sheds she caught a glimpse of the black mass of the boat, lying in beside the quay wall, with illumined portholes. She answered nothing. She felt her cheek pale and cold and, out of a maze of distress, she prayed to God to direct her, to show her what was her duty. The boat blew a long mournful whistle into the mist. If she went, tomorrow she would be on the sea with Frank, steaming towards Buenos Ayres. Their passage had been booked. Could she still draw back after all he had done for her? Her distress awoke a nausea in her body and she kept moving her lips in silent fervent prayer.\n\nA bell clanged upon her heart. She felt him seize her hand:\n\n“Come!”\n\nAll the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was drawing her into them: he would drown her. She gripped with both hands at the iron railing.\n\n“Come!”\n\nNo! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron in frenzy. Amid the seas she sent a cry of anguish!\n\n“Eveline! Evvy!”\n\nHe rushed beyond the barrier and called to her to follow. He was shouted at to go on but he still called to her. She set her white face to him, passive, like a helpless animal. Her eyes gave him no sign of love or farewell or recognition."], ["snippet", "She sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue.

I witnessed the end of the world. And since I'm the only human who saw it, I'm going to write it down, even though there won't be any more generations of humans to read it. Somehow I need to. Perhaps another species will learn from our experience. Probably not. Certainly we never imagined how dangerous a galaxy we grew up in.\n\nContext: even though born decades after Cernan made the last bootprint on the Moon, I've dreamed of going into space for as long as I can remember. I'd lie in bed at night and imagine my bedroom suddenly transformed into zero G. I'd push myself off from a wall, feeling the exquisite back-pressure of pure inertia as I squeezed my fingers to launch myself; I'd do lazy back flips and twists in mid-air, then use my toes to spring from the opposite wall. I occupied myself with all the usual space-kid stuff: model rockets, reading astronaut memoirs, even joining one of the groups lobbying for more taxpayer money for socialist space programs. But even in high school I'd faced the fact that the only way I'd ever make it to orbit would be to turn myself into a politically-correct government funded parasite, then spend a career in a program completely decoupled from the true human destiny in space. No thanks; I'd rather program computers.\n\nThen came the Fourth of August: decapitation. Amid the shock and chaos that ensued, only a few (far wiser than this high school kid) imagined that the destruction of Washington would indirectly open the road to the stars. Like so many of the private initiatives that sprang up in the years of recovery and the dawn of the Republic, the Band of Billionaires and the GEOSPACE corporation they founded would invigorate industries grown sclerotic from decades of regulation and inspire a generation to realise their dreams, working toward their own personal future beyond the home planet.\n\nIt sure was that way for me. In my junior year of college, I changed my major to aerospace, and started to catch up on thermogoddamics, fluids, and all the real engineering I'd ignored while fooling around with computers. It would take me an extra year to graduate, but equip me for a career in space.\n\nAfter the obligatory master's degree, flight school indenture, National Service as a militia pilot, and five years of working up the ladder at GEOSPACE, I'd made it off-planet as an interorbital ferry pilot (the word “shuttle” having become as disreputable as “appeasement” and “root cause”), driving technicians and gear back and forth between the Low Earth Orbit logistics base and the GEOCans. After economics finally prevailed over national pride, it was obvious that sprinkling dozens of satellites around geosynchronous orbit was an insane way to go about global communication. Far wiser to concentrate everything in a small number of geostationary platforms (visionaries always fastened on the minimum of three, but actually six ultimately made the most sense), cross-linked by high bandwidth lasers. On each GEOCan (supposedly from “GEOSPACE Communication Array Node”, but really because the pressurised module resembled a beer can), tenants shared solar panels, transmitters and phased array antennas, but supplied their own switching, signal processing, and beam directing gear. The six GEOCans were hardly high tech, but then nothing GEOSPACE did was, really. But they made money—cubic acres of the stuff. The GEOCans were actually based on the design of the laboratory modules for the grotesque “International Space Station” that scattered debris all over China two years after the decapitation. Once the GEOSPACE engineers ripped out all the gold-plating and safetyland silliness, what remained was a suitable pressure vessel and logistics system for the GEOCans.\n\nThis was my third trip to a GEOCan as pilot—this time GEOCan Asia, above Singapore at 105 degrees East; what a view! We'd embarked three tonnes of cargo and five technicians at the GEOSPACE LEO base for the run uphill. Like most logistics missions, we'd top up station keeping fuel, but most of our cargo was changeouts for gear in the racks inside the GEOCan—signal processors, amplifiers, and so forth. The techs understand this stuff (or at least how to hook it up); I just drive the bus. After docking, completing the propellant transfer, hooking up the life support system in the GEOCan to the consumables and scrubbers in the ferry, and checking the atmosphere in the GEOCan, my work was done until it was time to undock and burn Earth transfer orbit. The techs were busy in the GEOCan removing old gear and installing the new, muttering to themselves in Russian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and English, and bitching to one another in the latter. I was floating in my ferry pilot's seat, listening to the chatter on the intercom, but mostly alternating between studying and looking out the window.\n\nStudying—my next career goal (it seems so trivial, now) was to land a first officer's seat on a GEOSPACE Trans-Atmospheric Transport, then move up after a couple of years to captain. Flying back and forth from Omaha spaceport to low Earth orbit may not seem as romantic as boosting up to where the Earth looks the size of a soccer ball, but it pays a lot better, plus you get to sleep in your own bed every night and shower regularly. With the majority of TAT flights already going to the first GEOSPACE Orbital Hotel (dubbed “Sin Star” by the fundies—beats me what so disturbs them about zero-G volleyball), and the tourist sector growing rapidly as volume drove the costs down, that's where the money was. Besides, with luck and enough seniority in the left seat of a TAT, I'd be in line to command a lunar ferry once GEOSPACE started to open the Moon to tourism.\n\nNow, GEOSPACE could possibly afford to lose a ferry with a bunch of techs and some comm gear. The insurance would cover it and, Hell, we all fought to get our jobs. But losing a TAT with 70 tourists returning from holiday would in all likelihood sink not only the space tourism business but GEOSPACE as well. To be entrusted with one of those vehicles you had to be the very best of the very best.\n\nWhich I was, of course. All I had to do was prove it.\n\nSo, there I was, reviewing the TAT systems manual for the thousandth time in preparation for my first “informal” interview with the chief of the TAT crew office next month. I can hand fly anything with better L/D than a watermelon, but there's only so much a meat computer can absorb in a given amount of time from prose like, “If the primary yaw RCS fails and the prime FCS fails over to the backup yaw RCS and the RCS anomaly annunciator fails to indicate the fault, the master caution and warning system will indicate status 5104, which may be queried on the primary or backup flight display system. But if the backup FCS is active, no indication of the failure of primary yaw RCS will be given if the RCS anomaly annunciator has also failed.” Imagine seventeen thousand pages of this, and eventually being tested on all of it in the simulator.\n\nMine eyes, having thoroughly glazed over, gazed upward from the screen toward the ever-fascinating Earth almost centred in the cockpit window. Suddenly, what is that? An impossibly brilliant star came into view from the right, moving toward the Earth with an angular velocity you simply never see in space. It may have been bigger than a point source, but I don't think so. It took no more than a second to cross the two Earth diameters from where I first spotted it to the point of impact not far from the illuminated limb, a bit north of the equator.\n\nAll Hell broke loose. The impact instantaneously ejected a plume of plasma, which began to rise outward at a speed much slower than the impactor arrived. I'm not sure about my perception of time from here on. There was no camera to record it, and when you're seeing something you've never, ever, expected to see, time gets elastic. I remember my parents talking about feeling that way when “the twin towers fell.” I'm too young to remember that.\n\nWhatever the timing, this is what happened. The Earth seemed to shudder, then the ocean began to blow off into a steam cloud which visibly inflated the atmosphere and turned it white as it progressed along a spherical front from the point of impact. Then the Earth, which now seemed puckered near the impact point on the right limb where the plasma was dispersing into space, belched out a spout of incandescent magma from behind the dark left limb. The spout may have gone into orbit; there may be a new Moon. Too bad there won't be any lovers to see it. The white wave continued to spread around the globe as the shock wave progressed and the oceans vaporised. It moved slower than one might expect, but advanced at an absolutely constant rate: the curtain of extinction ringing down upon the biosphere. Then a shudder happened about 270 degrees from the point of impact and a white band began to propagate outward in both directions from there. When all of these converged behind the dark limb something happened which looked like a secondary ejecta event, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nMoments after the impact I keyed the intercom to the techs in the GEOCan. “Folks, something's happened. Get up here right away.” I wasn't trying to demonstrate sang-froid—I'm a pilot with more than 3000 hours and that's how I talk. One by one, they floated onto the flight deck and looked out the window. All of us were struck silent by what we were witnessing. We'd lost the feeds from everything on Earth within 20 seconds of the impact. The cross-feeds from the other GEOCans were still up but nothing but carrier. By the time anybody spoke, Earth was a featureless white ball with ejecta coalescing into an arc around it.\n\nI described the arrival of the impactor and the events before they'd arrived on the flight deck. Vasily shook his head and said, “We've known this risk since Tunguska, and what have we done—nothing. We go to space so monkeys can chatter at one another.” Yutaka disagreed, “This was not an impact by a solar system body.” He turned to me. “Peter, how long did you say it took for the impactor to come in from the point where you spotted it?” “About a second to cross two Earth diameters”, I replied.\n\nYutaka drew his computer from its holster and tapped away for a few seconds. He paused, shook his head, tapped some more, then said slowly, “Whatever it was, it came in at about ten percent of the speed of light. Dynamically, that object didn't belong to the solar system, or for that matter the galaxy. It was going…”, tap, tap, tap, “more than seven hundred times too fast to be gravitationally bound to the Sun, and sixty times the escape velocity of the galaxy.”\n\n“So what was it?”, asked Jiang. I pondered the question. “Well, there are really only two possibilities”, I said. “An impactor's first acquiring relativistic velocity by successive random gravitational encounters, then managing to hit a target the size of the Earth is something so fantastically improbable it's unlikely to have happened anywhere in the universe since the big bang. So if that's what happened, we have just witnessed the single worst case of bad luck since Creation.” “Other possibility?”, asked Vasily.\n\n“That we've just witnessed the deliberate destruction of the Earth by hostile aliens.”\n\nWe talked about these issues for several hours and then, having nothing more to say and nothing to look at besides the white ball our home planet had become, one by one we went to sleep. Maybe you find it hard to imagine going to sleep after watching the destruction of your entire species, but eventually you get tired enough and sleep overtakes you. It's not like we expected a wake-up call next morning.\n\nThe next day we monitored and tried calling on all frequencies the GEOCan could access. The GPS constellation remained on the air, but the ephemeris in the satellites showed no update since the impact. The other GEOCans maintained their laser links with ours, but all indicated no uplink from Earth or LEO and our transmissions relayed through them elicited no reply. We were the only crew above LEO at the time of the impact. The clearly visible expansion of the atmosphere as the oceans flashed into steam had been more than enough to bring down any satellite in LEO, including the logistics base, Hotel, and any TATs en route. We had supplies for 12 days at GEO even though we'd only expected to stay for three. With nothing better to do, we spent most of the day in rather maudlin recollections of Earth. Our crew, all young, male, and apart from Jiang, single, probably took the end of human history better than most might have, but there'd be no way to repeat the experiment with other humans. We were it.\n\nThree days passed. We did routine housekeeping, scanned Earth and the other GEOCans for signals, finding nothing. We took pictures of the coalescence of the ejecta from the impact into a ring which now seemed to be punctuated by the core of an inner moon. There was nothing else to do. All of us were mission-oriented people, so we did our jobs. It seems crazy, but what was the alternative? I mean, otherwise, we might be fired.\n\nAround mid-day, four days after the impact, the ship arrived.\n\nYutaka, Jiang, and I were on the flight deck when it appeared like a streak of light and seemed to instantaneously stop twenty metres in front of the ferry. It was huge, about 100 metres in diameter, perfectly spherical. The surface was primarily white, but with sub-structure that appeared fractal and seemed to constantly change. A tube extended from the craft toward our front docking port, where it engaged the drogue and triggered the contingency rescue hard dock. Over the intercom we heard, “Please open the hatch; we need to talk to you.” This in midwestern American English.\n\nWhen I cracked the hatch, there was no residual pressure differential, but the smell could knock you down. They floated through the hatch, one after another, five in all. If you're big on diversity, these are your kind of aliens. Two almost resembled greys out of a Whitley Streiber nightmare—dinky, big almond-shaped black eyes, gracile limbs, egg-shaped heads…but leathery ears, like a fox bat. Two more were vaguely lizard-like, but not all that creepy. They stood erect on two stumpy legs and had no obvious tail. Then there was the one with the tentacles on his (her, its?) face which smelled like…well, I've never smelled anything like that before…brrrr. They all seemed to have no difficulty breathing our atmosphere and if we smelled as bad to them, they gave no sign of it.\n\nThey seemed to have a strong sense of hierarchy. After speaking briefly to each member of the crew, each in his own mother tongue (colloquially, and without obvious accent), one of the greys approached and addressed me as “captain”. I denied the rank, but the grey insisted, “Based on our study of your species, one speaks for all on your ships.” With assent from the techs, I accepted that responsibility.\n\nIn bad situations, I like to get out in front of things, and this was about as bad a situation as I could imagine. I put my hands on my hips and asked the grey who stood before me, “Was it you who destroyed our world?”\n\n“It was.”\n\n“Why?”\n\nThe grey replied, “Because your planet presented an unprecedented risk to peace in the galaxy.”\n\nI paused, held my breath for a few seconds, then said, as calmly as I could manage, “Unprecedented risk? You have interstellar travel; you destroy entire planets with relativistic bullets, and you have no apparent compunctions about planetary ecocide. And you call us a risk?”\n\nThe grey raised its head and fixed me with its huge black eyes. They're not hypnotic—just black—nothing there at all, not even a reflection. It said, “We monitor electromagnetic emissions of all planets crossing the technological threshold. Never before have we found one which represents such a grave peril. Your species posed a threat so immediate, so acute, that not to act would have been negligent. We are not aggressors; we are galactic peacekeepers. We do not interfere with the development of any civilisation unless it threatens all of us who have renounced warfare.\n\n“Your United Federation of Planets, with its incessant conflict and meddling with other developing civilisations in direct violation of its own Prime Directive and our Fundamental Charter presented a clear and present danger to us. With warp drive, which we do not possess, and cloaking and subspace communications which enabled your Federation vessels and facilities to elude our sensors, we had no alternative but to act preemptively and decisively in self defence. We could not risk a conflict with your Federation.”\n\nVasily was the most enthusiastic Trekker on board. He flashed crimson, then shouted,\n\n“But there is no Federation, no warp, no cloaking, no subspace. That's nothing but science fiction.”\n\nThe aliens looked at one other and exchanged some words in a language none of us understood. Then the grey turned back to me and spoke.\n\n“We know science. What is fiction?”"], ["snippet", "I saw it happen. I witnessed the end of the world.

She had walked on the meadow paths with ascetic Indian philosophers imported by daughters-in-spirit of Madame Blavatsky. She had made pilgrimages to California's stucco jungles to hunt the astrological seer in his natural habitat.

Round trip slightly lower.\r\n\r\n\"Round trip,\" Mrs. Bellowes had thought. \"But who would come back after seeing Him?\"\r\nAnd so she had bought a ticket and flown off to Mars and spent seven mild days at Mr. Thirkell's Restorium, the building with the sign on it which flashed: THIRKELL'S ROCKET TO HEAVEN! She had spent the week bathing in limpid waters and erasing the care from her tiny bones, and now she was fidgeting, ready to be loaded into Mr. Thirkell's own special private rocket, like a bullet, to be fired on out into space beyond Jupiter and Saturn and Pluto. And thus—who could deny it?—you would be getting nearer and nearer to the Lord. How wonderful! Couldn't you just feel Him drawing near? Couldn't you just sense His breath, His scrutiny, His Presence?\r\n\"Here I am,\" said Mrs. Bellowes, \"an ancient rickety elevator, ready to go up the shaft. God need only press the button.\"\r\nNow, on the seventh day, as she minced up the steps of the Restorium, a number of small doubts assailed her.\r\n\"For one thing,\" she said aloud to no one, \"it isn't quite the land of milk and honey here on Mars that they said it would be. My room is like a cell, the swimming pool is really quite inadequate, and, besides, how many widows who look like mushrooms or skeletons want to swim? And, finally, the whole Restorium smells of boiled cabbage and tennis shoes!\"\r\nShe opened the front door and let it slam, somewhat irritably.\r\nShe was amazed at the other women in the auditorium. It was like wandering in a carnival mirror-maze, coming again and again upon yourself—the same floury face, the same chicken hands, and jingling bracelets. One after another of the images of herself floated before her. She put out her hand, but it wasn't a mirror; it was another lady shaking her fingers and saying:\r\n\"We're waiting for Mr. Thirkell. Sh!\"\r\n\"Ah,\" whispered everyone.\r\nThe velvet curtains parted.\r\nMr. Thirkell appeared, fantastically serene, his Egyptian eyes upon everyone. But there was something, nevertheless, in his appearance which made one expect him to call \"Hi!\" while fuzzy dogs jumped over his legs, through his hooped arms, and over his back. Then, dogs and all, he should dance with a dazzling piano-keyboard smile off into the wings.\r\nMrs. Bellowes, with a secret part of her mind which she constantly had to grip tightly, expected to hear a cheap Chinese gong sound when Mr. Thirkell entered. His large liquid dark eyes were so improbable that one of the old ladies had facetiously claimed she saw a mosquito cloud hovering over them as they did around summer rain-barrels. And Mrs. Bellowes sometimes caught the scent of the theatrical mothball and the smell of calliope steam on his sharply pressed suit.\r\nBut with the same savage rationalization that had greeted all other disappointments in her rickety life, she bit at the suspicion and whispered, \"This time it's real. This time it'll work. Haven't we got a rocket?\"\r\nMr. Thirkell bowed. He smiled a sudden Comedy Mask smile. The old ladies looked in at his epiglottis and sensed chaos there.\r\nBefore he even began to speak, Mrs. Bellowes saw him picking up each of his words, oiling it, making sure it ran smooth on its rails. Her heart squeezed in like a tiny fist, and she gritted her porcelain teeth.\r\n\"Friends,\" said Mr. Thirkell, and you could hear the frost snap in the hearts of the entire assemblage.\r\n\"No!\" said Mrs. Bellowes ahead of time. She could hear the bad news rushing at her, and herself tied to the track while the immense black wheels threatened and the whistle screamed, helpless.\r\n\"There will be a slight delay,\" said Mr. Thirkell.\r\nIn the next instant, Mr. Thirkell might have cried, or been tempted to cry, \"Ladies, be seated!\" in minstrel-fashion, for the ladies had come up at him from their chairs, protesting and trembling.\r\n\"Not a very long delay.\" Mr. Thirkell put up his hands to pat the air.\r\n\"How long?\"\r\n\"Only a week.\"\r\n\"A week!\"\r\n\"Yes. You can stay here at the Restorium for seven more days, can't you? A little delay won't matter, will it, in the end? You've waited a lifetime. Only a few more days.\"\r\nAt twenty dollars a day, thought Mrs. Bellowes, coldly.\r\n\"What's the trouble?\" a woman cried.\r\n\"A legal difficulty,\" said Mr. Thirkell.\r\n\"We've a rocket, haven't we?\"\r\n\"Well, ye-ess.\"\r\n\"But I've been here a whole month, waiting,\" said one old lady. \"Delays, delays!\"\r\n\"That's right,\" said everyone.\r\n\"Ladies, ladies,\" murmured Mr. Thirkell, smiling serenely.\r\n\"We want to see the rocket!\" It was Mrs. Bellowes forging ahead, alone, brandishing her fist like a toy hammer.\r\nMr. Thirkell looked into the old ladies' eyes, a missionary among albino cannibals.\r\n\"Well, now,\" he said.\r\n\"Yes, now!\" cried Mrs. Bellowes.\r\n\"I'm afraid—\" he began.\r\n\"So am I!\" she said. \"That's why we want to see the ship!\"\r\n\"No, no, now, Mrs.—\" He snapped his fingers for her name.\r\n\"Bellowes!\" she cried. She was a small container, but now all the seething pressures that had been built up over long years came steaming through the delicate vents of her body. Her cheeks became incandescent. With a wail that was like a melancholy factory whistle, Mrs. Bellowes ran forward and hung to him, almost by her teeth, like a summer-maddened Spitz. She would not and never could let go, until he died, and the other women followed, jumping and yapping like a pound let loose on its trainer, the same one who had petted them and to whom they had squirmed and whined joyfully an hour before, now milling about him, creasing his sleeves and frightening the Egyptian serenity from his gaze.\r\n\"This way!\" cried Mrs. Bellowes, feeling like Madame Lafarge. \"Through the back! We've waited long enough to see the ship. Every day he's put us off, every day we've waited, now let's see.\"\r\n\"No, no, ladies!\" cried Mr. Thirkell, leaping about.\r\nThey burst through the back of the stage and out a door, like a flood, bearing the poor man with them into a shed, and then out, quite suddenly, into an abandoned gymnasium.\r\n\"There it is!\" said someone. \"The rocket.\"\r\nAnd then a silence fell that was terrible to entertain.\r\nThere was the rocket.\r\nMrs. Bellowes looked at it and her hands sagged away from Mr. Thirkell's collar.\r\nThe rocket was something like a battered copper pot. There were a thousand bulges and rents and rusty pipes and dirty vents on and in it. The ports were clouded over with dust, resembling the eyes of a blind hog.\r\nEveryone wailed a little sighing wail.\r\n\"Is that the rocket ship Glory Be to the Highest?\" cried Mrs. Bellowes, appalled.\r\nMr. Thirkell nodded and looked at his feet.\r\n\"For which we paid out our one thousand dollars apiece and came all the way to Mars to get on board with you and go off to find Him?\" asked Mrs. Bellowes.\r\n\"Why, that isn't worth a sack of dried peas,\" said Mrs. Bellowes.\r\n\"It's nothing but junk!\"\r\nJunk, whispered everyone, getting hysterical.\r\n\"Don't let him get away!\"\r\nMr. Thirkell tried to break and run, but a thousand possum traps closed on him from every side. He withered.\r\nEverybody walked around in circles like blind mice. There was a confusion and a weeping that lasted for five minutes as they went over and touched the Rocket, the Dented Kettle, the Rusty Container for God's Children.\r\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Bellowes. She stepped up into the askew doorway of the rocket and faced everyone. \"It looks as if a terrible thing has been done to us,\" she said. \"I haven't any money to go back home to Earth and I've too much pride to go to the Government and tell them a common man like this has fooled us out of our life's savings. I don't know how you feel about it, all of you, but the reason all of us came is because I'm eighty-five, and you're eighty-nine, and you're seventy-eight, and all of us are nudging on toward a hundred, and there's nothing on Earth for us, and it doesn't appear there's anything on Mars either. We all expected not to breathe much more air or crochet many more doilies or we'd never have come here. So what I have to propose is a simple thing—to take a chance.\"\r\nShe reached out and touched the rusted hulk of the rocket.\r\n\"This is our rocket. We paid for our trip. And we're going to take our trip!\"\r\nEveryone rustled and stood on tiptoes and opened an astonished mouth.\r\nMr. Thirkell began to cry. He did it quite easily and very effectively.\r\n\"We're going to get in this ship,\" said Mrs. Bellowes, ignoring him. \"And we're going to take off to where we were going.\"\r\nMr. Thirkell stopped crying long enough to say, \"But it was all a fake. I don't know anything about space. He's not out there, anyway. I lied. I don't know where He is, and I couldn't find Him if I wanted to. And you were fools to ever take my word on it.\"\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Bellowes, \"we were fools. I'll go along on that. But you can't blame us, for we're old, and it was a lovely, good and fine idea, one of the loveliest ideas in the world. Oh, we didn't really fool ourselves that we could get nearer to Him physically. It was the gentle, mad dream of old people, the kind of thing you hold onto for a few minutes a day, even though you know it's not true. So, all of you who want to go, you follow me in the ship.\"\r\n\"But you can't go!\" said Mr. Thirkell. \"You haven't got a navigator. And that ship's a ruin!\"\r\n\"You,\" said Mrs. Bellowes, \"will be the navigator.\"\r\nShe stepped into the ship, and after a moment, the other old ladies pressed forward. Mr. Thirkell, windmilling his arms frantically, was nevertheless pressed through the port, and in a minute the door slammed shut. Mr. Thirkell was strapped into the navigator's seat, with everyone talking at once and holding him down. The special helmets were issued to be fitted over every gray or white head to supply extra oxygen in case of a leakage in the ship's hull, and at long last the hour had come and Mrs. Bellowes stood behind Mr. Thirkell and said, \"We're ready, sir.\"\r\nHe said nothing. He pleaded with them silently, using his great, dark, wet eyes, but Mrs. Bellowes shook her head and pointed to the control.\r\n\"Takeoff,\" agreed Mr. Thirkell morosely, and pulled a switch.\r\nEverybody fell. The rocket went up from the planet Mars in a great fiery glide, with the noise of an entire kitchen thrown down an elevator shaft, with a sound of pots and pans and kettles and fires boiling and stews bubbling, with a smell of burned incense and rubber and sulphur, with a color of yellow fire, and a ribbon of red stretching below them, and all the old women singing and holding to each other, and Mrs. Bellowes crawling upright in the sighing, straining, trembling ship.\r\n\"Head for space, Mr. Thirkell.\"\r\n\"It can't last,\" said Mr. Thirkell, sadly. \"This ship can't last. It will—\"\r\nIt did.\r\nThe rocket exploded.\r\nMrs. Bellowes felt herself lifted and thrown about dizzily, like a doll. She heard the great screamings and saw the flashes of bodies sailing by her in fragments of metal and powdery light.\r\n\"Help, help!\" cried Mr. Thirkell, far away, on a small radio beam.\r\nThe ship disintegrated into a million parts, and the old ladies, all one hundred of them, were flung straight on ahead with the same velocity as the ship.\r\nAs for Mr. Thirkell, for some reason of trajectory, perhaps, he had been blown out the other side of the ship. Mrs. Bellowes saw him falling separate and away from them, screaming, screaming.\r\nThere goes Mr. Thirkell, thought Mrs. Bellowes.\r\nAnd she knew where he was going. He was going to be burned and roasted and broiled good, but very good.\r\nMr. Thirkell was falling down into the Sun.\r\nAnd here we are, thought Mrs. Bellowes. Here we are, going on out, and out, and out.\r\nThere was hardly a sense of motion at all, but she knew that she was traveling at fifty thousand miles an hour and would continue to travel at that speed for an eternity, until....\r\nShe saw the other women swinging all about her in their own trajectories, a few minutes of oxygen left to each of them in their helmets, and each was looking up to where they were going.\r\nOf course, thought Mrs. Bellowes. Out into space. Out and out, and the darkness like a great church, and the stars like candles, and in spite of everything, Mr. Thirkell, the rocket, and the dishonesty, we are going toward the Lord.\r\nAnd there, yes, there, as she fell on and on, coming toward her, she could almost discern the outline now, coming toward her was His mighty golden hand, reaching down to hold her and comfort her like a frightened sparrow....\r\n\"I'm Mrs. Amelia Bellowes,\" she said quietly, in her best company voice. \"I'm from the planet Earth.\""}

She stepped up into the askew doorway of the rocket and faced everyone. \"It looks as if a terrible thing has been done to us,\" she said. \"I haven't any money to go back home to Earth and I've too much pride to go to the Government and tell them a common man like this has fooled us out of our life's savings. I don't know how you feel about it, all of you, but the reason all of us came is because I'm eighty-five, and you're eighty-nine, and you're seventy-eight, and all of us are nudging on toward a hundred, and there's nothing on Earth for us, and it doesn't appear there's anything on Mars either. We all expected not to breathe much more air or crochet many more doilies or we'd never have come here. So what I have to propose is a simple thing—to take a chance.\"\r\nShe reached out and touched the rusted hulk of the rocket.\r\n\"This is our rocket. We paid for our trip. And we're going to take our trip!\"\r\nEveryone rustled and stood on tiptoes and opened an astonished mouth.\r\nMr. Thirkell began to cry. He did it quite easily and very effectively.\r\n\"We're going to get in this ship,\" said Mrs. Bellowes, ignoring him. \"And we're going to take off to where we were going.\"\r\nMr. Thirkell stopped crying long enough to say, \"But it was all a fake. I don't know anything about space. He's not out there, anyway. I lied. I don't know where He is, and I couldn't find Him if I wanted to. And you were fools to ever take my word on it.\"\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Bellowes, \"we were fools. I'll go along on that. But you can't blame us, for we're old, and it was a lovely, good and fine idea, one of the loveliest ideas in the world. Oh, we didn't really fool ourselves that we could get nearer to Him physically. It was the gentle, mad dream of old people, the kind of thing you hold onto for a few minutes a day, even though you know it's not true. So, all of you who want to go, you follow me in the ship.\"\r\n\"But you can't go!\" said Mr. Thirkell. \"You haven't got a navigator. And that ship's a ruin!\"\r\n\"You,\" said Mrs. Bellowes, \"will be the navigator.\"\r\nShe stepped into the ship, and after a moment, the other old ladies pressed forward. Mr. Thirkell, windmilling his arms frantically, was nevertheless pressed through the port, and in a minute the door slammed shut. Mr. Thirkell was strapped into the navigator's seat, with everyone talking at once and holding him down. The special helmets were issued to be fitted over every gray or white head to supply extra oxygen in case of a leakage in the ship's hull, and at long last the hour had come and Mrs. Bellowes stood behind Mr. Thirkell and said, \"We're ready, sir.\"\r\nHe said nothing. He pleaded with them silently, using his great, dark, wet eyes, but Mrs. Bellowes shook her head and pointed to the control.\r\n\"Takeoff,\" agreed Mr. Thirkell morosely, and pulled a switch.\r\nEverybody fell. The rocket went up from the planet Mars in a great fiery glide, with the noise of an entire kitchen thrown down an elevator shaft, with a sound of pots and pans and kettles and fires boiling and stews bubbling, with a smell of burned incense and rubber and sulphur, with a color of yellow fire, and a ribbon of red stretching below them, and all the old women singing and holding to each other, and Mrs. Bellowes crawling upright in the sighing, straining, trembling ship.\r\n\"Head for space, Mr. Thirkell.\"\r\n\"It can't last,\" said Mr. Thirkell, sadly. \"This ship can't last. It will—\"\r\nIt did.\r\nThe rocket exploded.\r\nMrs. Bellowes felt herself lifted and thrown about dizzily, like a doll. She heard the great screamings and saw the flashes of bodies sailing by her in fragments of metal and powdery light.\r\n\"Help, help!\" cried Mr. Thirkell, far away, on a small radio beam.\r\nThe ship disintegrated into a million parts, and the old ladies, all one hundred of them, were flung straight on ahead with the same velocity as the ship.\r\nAs for Mr. Thirkell, for some reason of trajectory, perhaps, he had been blown out the other side of the ship. Mrs. Bellowes saw him falling separate and away from them, screaming, screaming.\r\nThere goes Mr. Thirkell, thought Mrs. Bellowes.\r\nAnd she knew where he was going. He was going to be burned and roasted and broiled good, but very good.\r\nMr. Thirkell was falling down into the Sun.\r\nAnd here we are, thought Mrs. Bellowes. Here we are, going on out, and out, and out.\r\nThere was hardly a sense of motion at all, but she knew that she was traveling at fifty thousand miles an hour and would continue to travel at that speed for an eternity, until....\r\nShe saw the other women swinging all about her in their own trajectories, a few minutes of oxygen left to each of them in their helmets, and each was looking up to where they were going.\r\nOf course, thought Mrs. Bellowes. Out into space. Out and out, and the darkness like a great church, and the stars like candles, and in spite of everything, Mr. Thirkell, the rocket, and the dishonesty, we are going toward the Lord.\r\nAnd there, yes, there, as she fell on and on, coming toward her, she could almost discern the outline now, coming toward her was His mighty golden hand, reaching down to hold her and comfort her like a frightened sparrow....\r\n\"I'm Mrs. Amelia Bellowes,\" she said quietly, in her best company voice. \"I'm from the planet Earth.\""], ["snippet", "There were two important things—one, that she was very old; two, that Mr. Thirkell was taking her to God. For hadn't he patted her hand and said: \"Mrs. Bellowes, we'll take off into space in my rocket, and go to find Him together.\"\r\nAnd that was how it was going to be. Oh, this wasn't like any other group Mrs. Bellowes had ever joined. In her fervor to light a path for her delicate, tottering feet, she had struck matches down dark alleys, and found her way to Hindu mystics who floated their flickering, starry eyelashes over crystal balls."], ["created_at", 2017-04-01 21:51:17 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-04-01 21:51:17 UTC], ["genre_id", 2]]

Doris stared at it, her hand to her mouth. \"My God, what is it?\" She looked up at him, bright-eyed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, open it.\"\r\n\r\nDoris tore the ribbon and paper from the square package with her sharp nails, her bosom rising and falling. Larry stood watching her as she lifted the lid. He lit a cigarette and leaned against the wall.\r\n\r\n\"A cuckoo clock!\" Doris cried. \"A real old cuckoo clock like my mother had.\" She turned the clock over and over. \"Just like my mother had, when Pete was still alive.\" Her eyes sparkled with tears.\r\n\r\n\"It's made in Germany,\" Larry said. After a moment he added, \"Carl got it for me wholesale. He knows some guy in the clock business. Otherwise I wouldn't have—\" He stopped.\r\n\r\nDoris made a funny little sound.\r\n\r\n\"I mean, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to afford it.\" He scowled. \"What's the matter with you? You've got your clock, haven't you? Isn't that what you want?\"\r\n\r\nDoris sat holding onto the clock, her fingers pressed against the brown wood.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Larry said, \"what's the matter?\"\r\n\r\nHe watched in amazement as she leaped up and ran from the room, still clutching the clock. He shook his head. \"Never satisfied. They're all that way. Never get enough.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down at the table and finished his meal.\r\n\r\nThe cuckoo clock was not very large. It was hand-made, however, and there were countless frets on it, little indentations and ornaments scored in the soft wood. Doris sat on the bed drying her eyes and winding the clock. She set the hands by her wristwatch. Presently she carefully moved the hands to two minutes of ten. She carried the clock over to the dresser and propped it up.\r\n\r\nThen she sat waiting, her hands twisted together in her lap—waiting for the cuckoo to come out, for the hour to strike.\r\n\r\nAs she sat she thought about Larry and what he had said. And what she had said, too, for that matter—not that she could be blamed for any of it. After all, she couldn't keep listening to him forever without defending herself; you had to blow your own trumpet in the world.\r\n\r\nShe touched her handkerchief to her eyes suddenly. Why did he have to say that, about getting it wholesale? Why did he have to spoil it all? If he felt that way he needn't have got it in the first place. She clenched her fists. He was so mean, so damn mean.\r\n\r\nBut she was glad of the little clock sitting there ticking to itself, with its funny grilled edges and the door. Inside the door was the cuckoo, waiting to come out. Was he listening, his head cocked on one side, listening to hear the clock strike so that he would know to come out?\r\n\r\nDid he sleep between hours? Well, she would soon see him: she could ask him. And she would show the clock to Bob. He would love it; Bob loved old things, even old stamps and buttons. He liked to go with her to the stores. Of course, it was a little awkward, but Larry had been staying at the office so much, and that helped. If only Larry didn't call up sometimes to—\r\n\r\nThere was a whirr. The clock shuddered and all at once the door opened. The cuckoo came out, sliding swiftly. He paused and looked around solemnly, scrutinizing her, the room, the furniture.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time he had seen her, she realized, smiling to herself in pleasure. She stood up, coming toward him shyly. \"Go on,\" she said. \"I'm waiting.\"\r\n\r\nThe cuckoo opened his bill. He whirred and chirped, quickly, rhythmically. Then, after a moment of contemplation, he retired. And the door snapped shut.\r\n\r\nShe was delighted. She clapped her hands and spun in a little circle. He was marvelous, perfect! And the way he had looked around, studying her, sizing her up. He liked her; she was certain of it. And she, of course, loved him at once, completely. He was just what she had hoped would come out of the little door.\r\n\r\nDoris went to the clock. She bent over the little door, her lips close to the wood. \"Do you hear me?\" she whispered. \"I think you're the most wonderful cuckoo in the world.\" She paused, embarrassed. \"I hope you'll like it here.\"\r\n\r\nThen she went downstairs again, slowly, her head high.\r\n\r\nLarry and the cuckoo clock really never got along well from the start. Doris said it was because he didn't wind it right, and it didn't like being only half-wound all the time. Larry turned the job of winding over to her; the cuckoo came out every quarter hour and ran the spring down without remorse, and someone had to be ever after it, winding it up again.\r\n\r\nDoris did her best, but she forgot a good deal of the time. Then Larry would throw his newspaper down with an elaborate weary motion and stand up. He would go into the dining-room where the clock was mounted on the wall over the fireplace. He would take the clock down and making sure that he had his thumb over the little door, he would wind it up.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you put your thumb over the door?\" Doris asked once.\r\n\r\n\"You're supposed to.\"\r\n\r\nShe raised an eyebrow. \"Are you sure? I wonder if it isn't that you don't want him to come out while you're standing so close.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you're afraid of him.\"\r\n\r\nLarry laughed. He put the clock back on the wall and gingerly removed his thumb. When Doris wasn't looking he examined his thumb.\r\n\r\nThere was still a trace of the nick cut out of the soft part of it. Who—or what—had pecked at him?\r\n\r\nOne Saturday morning, when Larry was down at the office working over some important special accounts, Bob Chambers came to the front porch and rang the bell.\r\n\r\nDoris was taking a quick shower. She dried herself and slipped into her robe. When she opened the door Bob stepped inside, grinning.\r\n\r\n\"Hi,\" he said, looking around.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right. Larry's at the office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine.\" Bob gazed at her slim legs below the hem of the robe. \"How nice you look today.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. \"Be careful! Maybe I shouldn't let you in after all.\"\r\n\r\nThey looked at one another, half amused half frightened. Presently Bob said, \"If you want, I'll—\"\r\n\r\n\"No, for God's sake.\" She caught hold of his sleeve. \"Just get out of the doorway so I can close it. Mrs. Peters across the street, you know.\"\r\n\r\nShe closed the door. \"And I want to show you something,\" she said. \"You haven't seen it.\"\r\n\r\nHe was interested. \"An antique? Or what?\"\r\n\r\nShe took his arm, leading him toward the dining-room. \"You'll love it, Bobby.\" She stopped, wide-eyed. \"I hope you will. You must; you must love it. It means so much to me—he means so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"He?\" Bob frowned. \"Who is he?\"\r\n\r\nDoris laughed. \"You're jealous! Come on.\" A moment later they stood before the clock, looking up at it. \"He'll come out in a few minutes. Wait until you see him. I know you two will get along just fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does Larry think of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't like each other. Sometimes when Larry's here he won't come out. Larry gets mad if he doesn't come out on time. He says—\"\r\n\r\n\"Says what?\"\r\n\r\nDoris looked down. \"He always says he's been robbed, even if he did get it wholesale.\" She brightened. \"But I know he won't come out because he doesn't like Larry. When I'm here alone he comes right out for me, every fifteen minutes, even though he really only has to come out on the hour.\"\r\n\r\nShe gazed up at the clock. \"He comes out for me because he wants to. We talk; I tell him things. Of course, I'd like to have him upstairs in my room, but it wouldn't be right.\"\r\n\r\nThere was the sound of footsteps on the front porch. They looked at each other, horrified.\r\n\r\nLarry pushed the front door open, grunting. He set his briefcase down and took off his hat. Then he saw Bob for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"Chambers. I'll be damned.\" His eyes narrowed. \"What are you doing here?\" He came into the dining-room. Doris drew her robe about her helplessly, backing away.\r\n\r\n\"I—\" Bob began. \"That is, we—\" He broke off, glancing at Doris. Suddenly the clock began to whirr. The cuckoo came rushing out, bursting into sound. Larry moved toward him.\r\n\r\n\"Shut that din off,\" he said. He raised his fist toward the clock. The cuckoo snapped into silence and retreated. The door closed. \"That's better.\" Larry studied Doris and Bob, standing mutely together.\r\n\r\n\"I came over to look at the clock,\" Bob said. \"Doris told me that it's a rare antique and that—\"\r\n\r\n\"Nuts. I bought it myself.\" Larry walked up to him. \"Get out of here.\" He turned to Doris. \"You too. And take that damn clock with you.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, rubbing his chin. \"No. Leave the clock here. It's mine; I bought it and paid for it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the weeks that followed after Doris left, Larry and the cuckoo clock got along even worse than before. For one thing, the cuckoo stayed inside most of the time, sometimes even at twelve o'clock when he should have been busiest. And if he did come out at all he usually spoke only once or twice, never the correct number of times. And there was a sullen, uncooperative note in his voice, a jarring sound that made Larry uneasy and a little angry.\r\n\r\nBut he kept the clock wound, because the house was very still and quiet and it got on his nerves not to hear someone running around, talking and dropping things. And even the whirring of a clock sounded good to him.\r\n\r\nBut he didn't like the cuckoo at all. And sometimes he spoke to him.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" he said late one night to the closed little door. \"I know you can hear me. I ought to give you back to the Germans—back to the Black Forest.\" He paced back and forth. \"I wonder what they're doing now, the two of them. That young punk with his books and his antiques. A man shouldn't be interested in antiques; that's for women.\"\r\n\r\nHe set his jaw. \"Isn't that right?\"\r\n\r\nThe clock said nothing. Larry walked up in front of it. \"Isn't that right?\" he demanded. \"Don't you have anything to say?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at the face of the clock. It was almost eleven, just a few seconds before the hour. \"All right. I'll wait until eleven. Then I want to hear what you have to say. You've been pretty quiet the last few weeks since she left.\"\r\n\r\nHe grinned wryly. \"Maybe you don't like it here since she's gone.\" He scowled. \"Well, I paid for you, and you're coming out whether you like it or not. You hear me?\"\r\n\r\nEleven o'clock came. Far off, at the end of town, the great tower clock boomed sleepily to itself. But the little door remained shut. Nothing moved. The minute hand passed on and the cuckoo did not stir. He was someplace inside the clock, beyond the door, silent and remote.\r\n\r\n\"All right, if that's the way you feel,\" Larry murmured, his lips twisting. \"But it isn't fair. It's your job to come out. We all have to do things we don't like.\"\r\n\r\nHe went unhappily into the kitchen and opened the great gleaming refrigerator. As he poured himself a drink he thought about the clock.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about it—the cuckoo should come out, Doris or no Doris. He had always liked her, from the very start. They had got along well, the two of them. Probably he liked Bob too—probably he had seen enough of Bob to get to know him. They would be quite happy together, Bob and Doris and the cuckoo.\r\n\r\nLarry finished his drink. He opened the drawer at the sink and took out the hammer. He carried it carefully into the dining-room. The clock was ticking gently to itself on the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" he said, waving the hammer. \"You know what I have here? You know what I'm going to do with it? I'm going to start on you—first.\" He smiled. \"Birds of a feather, that's what you are—the three of you.\"\r\n\r\nThe room was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Are you coming out? Or do I have to come in and get you?\"\r\n\r\nThe clock whirred a little.\r\n\r\n\"I hear you in there. You've got a lot of talking to do, enough for the last three weeks. As I figure it, you owe me—\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened. The cuckoo came out fast, straight at him. Larry was looking down, his brow wrinkled in thought. He glanced up, and the cuckoo caught him squarely in the eye.\r\n\r\nDown he went, hammer and chair and everything, hitting the floor with a tremendous crash. For a moment the cuckoo paused, its small body poised rigidly. Then it went back inside its house. The door snapped tight-shut after it.\r\n\r\nThe man lay on the floor, stretched out grotesquely, his head bent over to one side. Nothing moved or stirred. The room was completely silent, except, of course, for the ticking of the clock.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" Doris said, her face tight. Bob put his arm around her, steadying her.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" Bob said, \"can I ask you something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" the doctor said.\r\n\r\n\"Is it very easy to break your neck, falling from so low a chair? It wasn't very far to fall. I wonder if it might not have been an accident. Is there any chance it might have been—\"\r\n\r\n\"Suicide?\" the doctor rubbed his jaw. \"I never heard of anyone committing suicide that way. It was an accident; I'm positive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean suicide,\" Bob murmured under his breath, looking up at the clock on the wall. \"I meant something else.\"\r\n\r\nBut no one heard him."}

He would take the clock down and making sure that he had his thumb over the little door, he would wind it up.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you put your thumb over the door?\" Doris asked once.\r\n\r\n\"You're supposed to.\"\r\n\r\nShe raised an eyebrow. \"Are you sure? I wonder if it isn't that you don't want him to come out while you're standing so close.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you're afraid of him.\"\r\n\r\nLarry laughed. He put the clock back on the wall and gingerly removed his thumb. When Doris wasn't looking he examined his thumb.\r\n\r\nThere was still a trace of the nick cut out of the soft part of it. Who—or what—had pecked at him?\r\n\r\nOne Saturday morning, when Larry was down at the office working over some important special accounts, Bob Chambers came to the front porch and rang the bell.\r\n\r\nDoris was taking a quick shower. She dried herself and slipped into her robe. When she opened the door Bob stepped inside, grinning.\r\n\r\n\"Hi,\" he said, looking around.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right. Larry's at the office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine.\" Bob gazed at her slim legs below the hem of the robe. \"How nice you look today.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. \"Be careful! Maybe I shouldn't let you in after all.\"\r\n\r\nThey looked at one another, half amused half frightened. Presently Bob said, \"If you want, I'll—\"\r\n\r\n\"No, for God's sake.\" She caught hold of his sleeve. \"Just get out of the doorway so I can close it. Mrs. Peters across the street, you know.\"\r\n\r\nShe closed the door. \"And I want to show you something,\" she said. \"You haven't seen it.\"\r\n\r\nHe was interested. \"An antique? Or what?\"\r\n\r\nShe took his arm, leading him toward the dining-room. \"You'll love it, Bobby.\" She stopped, wide-eyed. \"I hope you will. You must; you must love it. It means so much to me—he means so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"He?\" Bob frowned. \"Who is he?\"\r\n\r\nDoris laughed. \"You're jealous! Come on.\" A moment later they stood before the clock, looking up at it. \"He'll come out in a few minutes. Wait until you see him. I know you two will get along just fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does Larry think of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't like each other. Sometimes when Larry's here he won't come out. Larry gets mad if he doesn't come out on time. He says—\"\r\n\r\n\"Says what?\"\r\n\r\nDoris looked down. \"He always says he's been robbed, even if he did get it wholesale.\" She brightened. \"But I know he won't come out because he doesn't like Larry. When I'm here alone he comes right out for me, every fifteen minutes, even though he really only has to come out on the hour.\"\r\n\r\nShe gazed up at the clock. \"He comes out for me because he wants to. We talk; I tell him things. Of course, I'd like to have him upstairs in my room, but it wouldn't be right.\"\r\n\r\nThere was the sound of footsteps on the front porch. They looked at each other, horrified.\r\n\r\nLarry pushed the front door open, grunting. He set his briefcase down and took off his hat. Then he saw Bob for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"Chambers. I'll be damned.\" His eyes narrowed. \"What are you doing here?\" He came into the dining-room. Doris drew her robe about her helplessly, backing away.\r\n\r\n\"I—\" Bob began. \"That is, we—\" He broke off, glancing at Doris. Suddenly the clock began to whirr. The cuckoo came rushing out, bursting into sound. Larry moved toward him.\r\n\r\n\"Shut that din off,\" he said. He raised his fist toward the clock. The cuckoo snapped into silence and retreated. The door closed. \"That's better.\" Larry studied Doris and Bob, standing mutely together.\r\n\r\n\"I came over to look at the clock,\" Bob said. \"Doris told me that it's a rare antique and that—\"\r\n\r\n\"Nuts. I bought it myself.\" Larry walked up to him. \"Get out of here.\" He turned to Doris. \"You too. And take that damn clock with you.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, rubbing his chin. \"No. Leave the clock here. It's mine; I bought it and paid for it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the weeks that followed after Doris left, Larry and the cuckoo clock got along even worse than before. For one thing, the cuckoo stayed inside most of the time, sometimes even at twelve o'clock when he should have been busiest. And if he did come out at all he usually spoke only once or twice, never the correct number of times. And there was a sullen, uncooperative note in his voice, a jarring sound that made Larry uneasy and a little angry.\r\n\r\nBut he kept the clock wound, because the house was very still and quiet and it got on his nerves not to hear someone running around, talking and dropping things. And even the whirring of a clock sounded good to him.\r\n\r\nBut he didn't like the cuckoo at all. And sometimes he spoke to him.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" he said late one night to the closed little door. \"I know you can hear me. I ought to give you back to the Germans—back to the Black Forest.\" He paced back and forth. \"I wonder what they're doing now, the two of them. That young punk with his books and his antiques. A man shouldn't be interested in antiques; that's for women.\"\r\n\r\nHe set his jaw. \"Isn't that right?\"\r\n\r\nThe clock said nothing. Larry walked up in front of it. \"Isn't that right?\" he demanded. \"Don't you have anything to say?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at the face of the clock. It was almost eleven, just a few seconds before the hour. \"All right. I'll wait until eleven. Then I want to hear what you have to say. You've been pretty quiet the last few weeks since she left.\"\r\n\r\nHe grinned wryly. \"Maybe you don't like it here since she's gone.\" He scowled. \"Well, I paid for you, and you're coming out whether you like it or not. You hear me?\"\r\n\r\nEleven o'clock came. Far off, at the end of town, the great tower clock boomed sleepily to itself. But the little door remained shut. Nothing moved. The minute hand passed on and the cuckoo did not stir. He was someplace inside the clock, beyond the door, silent and remote.\r\n\r\n\"All right, if that's the way you feel,\" Larry murmured, his lips twisting. \"But it isn't fair. It's your job to come out. We all have to do things we don't like.\"\r\n\r\nHe went unhappily into the kitchen and opened the great gleaming refrigerator. As he poured himself a drink he thought about the clock.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about it—the cuckoo should come out, Doris or no Doris. He had always liked her, from the very start. They had got along well, the two of them. Probably he liked Bob too—probably he had seen enough of Bob to get to know him. They would be quite happy together, Bob and Doris and the cuckoo.\r\n\r\nLarry finished his drink. He opened the drawer at the sink and took out the hammer. He carried it carefully into the dining-room. The clock was ticking gently to itself on the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" he said, waving the hammer. \"You know what I have here? You know what I'm going to do with it? I'm going to start on you—first.\" He smiled. \"Birds of a feather, that's what you are—the three of you.\"\r\n\r\nThe room was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Are you coming out? Or do I have to come in and get you?\"\r\n\r\nThe clock whirred a little.\r\n\r\n\"I hear you in there. You've got a lot of talking to do, enough for the last three weeks. As I figure it, you owe me—\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened. The cuckoo came out fast, straight at him. Larry was looking down, his brow wrinkled in thought. He glanced up, and the cuckoo caught him squarely in the eye.\r\n\r\nDown he went, hammer and chair and everything, hitting the floor with a tremendous crash. For a moment the cuckoo paused, its small body poised rigidly. Then it went back inside its house. The door snapped tight-shut after it.\r\n\r\nThe man lay on the floor, stretched out grotesquely, his head bent over to one side. Nothing moved or stirred. The room was completely silent, except, of course, for the ticking of the clock.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" Doris said, her face tight. Bob put his arm around her, steadying her.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" Bob said, \"can I ask you something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" the doctor said.\r\n\r\n\"Is it very easy to break your neck, falling from so low a chair? It wasn't very far to fall. I wonder if it might not have been an accident. Is there any chance it might have been—\"\r\n\r\n\"Suicide?\" the doctor rubbed his jaw. \"I never heard of anyone committing suicide that way. It was an accident; I'm positive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean suicide,\" Bob murmured under his breath, looking up at the clock on the wall. \"I meant something else.\"\r\n\r\nBut no one heard him."], ["snippet", "That night at the dinner table he brought it out and set it down beside her plate. Doris stared at it, her hand to her mouth. \"My God, what is it?\" She looked up at him, bright-eyed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, open it.\"\r\n\r\nDoris tore the ribbon and paper from the square package with her sharp nails, her bosom rising and falling. Larry stood watching her as she lifted the lid. He lit a cigarette and leaned against the wall."], ["created_at", 2017-04-01 21:52:39 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-04-01 21:52:39 UTC], ["genre_id", 2]]

It seemed to her a very large amount of money, and the way in which it stuffed and bulged her worn old porte-monnaie gave her a feeling of importance such as she had not enjoyed for years.\r\nThe question of investment was one that occupied her greatly. For a day or two she walked about apparently in a dreamy state, but really absorbed in speculation and calculation. She did not wish to act hastily, to do anything she might afterward regret. But it was during the still hours of the night when she lay awake revolving plans in her mind that she seemed to see her way clearly toward a proper and judicious use of the money.\r\nA dollar or two should be added to the price usually paid for Janie’s shoes, which would insure their lasting an appreciable time longer than they usually did. She would buy so and so many yards of percale for new shirt waists for the boys and Janie and Mag. She had intended to make the old ones do by skilful patching. Mag should have another gown. She had seen some beautiful patterns, veritable bargains in the shop windows. And still there would be left enough for new stockings—two pairs apiece—and what darning that would save for a while! She would get caps for the boys and sailor-hats for the girls. The vision of her little brood looking fresh and dainty and new for once in their lives excited her and made her restless and wakeful with anticipation.\r\nThe neighbors sometimes talked of certain “better days” that little Mrs. Sommers had known before she had ever thought of being Mrs. Sommers. She herself indulged in no such morbid retrospection. She had no time—no second of time to devote to the past. The needs of the present absorbed her every faculty. A vision of the future like some dim, gaunt monster sometimes appalled her, but luckily to-morrow never comes.\r\nMrs. Sommers was one who knew the value of bargains; who could stand for hours making her way inch by inch toward the desired object that was selling below cost. She could elbow her way if need be; she had learned to clutch a piece of goods and hold it and stick to it with persistence and determination till her turn came to be served, no matter when it came.\r\nBut that day she was a little faint and tired. She had swallowed a light luncheon—no! when she came to think of it, between getting the children fed and the place righted, and preparing herself for the shopping bout, she had actually forgotten to eat any luncheon at all!\r\nShe sat herself upon a revolving stool before a counter that was comparatively deserted, trying to gather strength and courage to charge through an eager multitude that was besieging breastworks of shirting and figured lawn. An all-gone limp feeling had come over her and she rested her hand aimlessly upon the counter. She wore no gloves. By degrees she grew aware that her hand had encountered something very soothing, very pleasant to touch. She looked down to see that her hand lay upon a pile of silk stockings. A placard near by announced that they had been reduced in price from two dollars and fifty cents to one dollar and ninety-eight cents; and a young girl who stood behind the counter asked her if she wished to examine their line of silk hosiery. She smiled, just as if she had been asked to inspect a tiara of diamonds with the ultimate view of purchasing it. But she went on feeling the soft, sheeny luxurious things—with both hands now, holding them up to see them glisten, and to feel them glide serpent-like through her fingers.\r\nTwo hectic blotches came suddenly into her pale cheeks. She looked up at the girl.\r\n“Do you think there are any eights-and-a-half among these?”\r\nThere were any number of eights-and-a-half. In fact, there were more of that size than any other. Here was a light-blue pair; there were some lavender, some all black and various shades of tan and gray. Mrs. Sommers selected a black pair and looked at them very long and closely. She pretended to be examining their texture, which the clerk assured her was excellent.\r\n“A dollar and ninety-eight cents,” she mused aloud. “Well, I’ll take this pair.” She handed the girl a five-dollar bill and waited for her change and for her parcel. What a very small parcel it was! It seemed lost in the depths of her shabby old shopping-bag.\r\nMrs. Sommers after that did not move in the direction of the bargain counter. She took the elevator, which carried her to an upper floor into the region of the ladies’ waiting-rooms. Here, in a retired corner, she exchanged her cotton stockings for the new silk ones which she had just bought. She was not going through any acute mental process or reasoning with herself, nor was she striving to explain to her satisfaction the motive of her action. She was not thinking at all. She seemed for the time to be taking a rest from that laborious and fatiguing function and to have abandoned herself to some mechanical impulse that directed her actions and freed her of responsibility.\r\nHow good was the touch of the raw silk to her flesh! She felt like lying back in the cushioned chair and reveling for a while in the luxury of it. She did for a little while. Then she replaced her shoes, rolled the cotton stockings together and thrust them into her bag. After doing this she crossed straight over to the shoe department and took her seat to be fitted.\r\nShe was fastidious. The clerk could not make her out; he could not reconcile her shoes with her stockings, and she was not too easily pleased. She held back her skirts and turned her feet one way and her head another way as she glanced down at the polished, pointed-tipped boots. Her foot and ankle looked very pretty. She could not realize that they belonged to her and were a part of herself. She wanted an excellent and stylish fit, she told the young fellow who served her, and she did not mind the difference of a dollar or two more in the price so long as she got what she desired.\r\nIt was a long time since Mrs. Sommers had been fitted with gloves. On rare occasions when she had bought a pair they were always “bargains,” so cheap that it would have been preposterous and unreasonable to have expected them to be fitted to the hand.\r\nNow she rested her elbow on the cushion of the glove counter, and a pretty, pleasant young creature, delicate and deft of touch, drew a long-wristed “kid” over Mrs. Sommers’s hand. She smoothed it down over the wrist and buttoned it neatly, and both lost themselves for a second or two in admiring contemplation of the little symmetrical gloved hand. But there were other places where money might be spent.\r\nThere were books and magazines piled up in the window of a stall a few paces down the street. Mrs. Sommers bought two high-priced magazines such as she had been accustomed to read in the days when she had been accustomed to other pleasant things. She carried them without wrapping. As well as she could she lifted her skirts at the crossings. Her stockings and boots and well fitting gloves had worked marvels in her bearing—had given her a feeling of assurance, a sense of belonging to the well-dressed multitude.\r\nShe was very hungry. Another time she would have stilled the cravings for food until reaching her own home, where she would have brewed herself a cup of tea and taken a snack of anything that was available. But the impulse that was guiding her would not suffer her to entertain any such thought.\r\nThere was a restaurant at the corner. She had never entered its doors; from the outside she had sometimes caught glimpses of spotless damask and shining crystal, and soft-stepping waiters serving people of fashion.\r\nWhen she entered her appearance created no surprise, no consternation, as she had half feared it might. She seated herself at a small table alone, and an attentive waiter at once approached to take her order. She did not want a profusion; she craved a nice and tasty bite—a half dozen blue-points, a plump chop with cress, a something sweet—a creme-frappee, for instance; a glass of Rhine wine, and after all a small cup of black coffee.\r\nWhile waiting to be served she removed her gloves very leisurely and laid them beside her. Then she picked up a magazine and glanced through it, cutting the pages with a blunt edge of her knife. It was all very agreeable. The damask was even more spotless than it had seemed through the window, and the crystal more sparkling. There were quiet ladies and gentlemen, who did not notice her, lunching at the small tables like her own. A soft, pleasing strain of music could be heard, and a gentle breeze, was blowing through the window. She tasted a bite, and she read a word or two, and she sipped the amber wine and wiggled her toes in the silk stockings. The price of it made no difference. She counted the money out to the waiter and left an extra coin on his tray, whereupon he bowed before her as before a princess of royal blood.\r\nThere was still money in her purse, and her next temptation presented itself in the shape of a matinee poster.\r\nIt was a little later when she entered the theatre, the play had begun and the house seemed to her to be packed. But there were vacant seats here and there, and into one of them she was ushered, between brilliantly dressed women who had gone there to kill time and eat candy and display their gaudy attire. There were many others who were there solely for the play and acting. It is safe to say there was no one present who bore quite the attitude which Mrs. Sommers did to her surroundings. She gathered in the whole—stage and players and people in one wide impression, and absorbed it and enjoyed it. She laughed at the comedy and wept—she and the gaudy woman next to her wept over the tragedy. And they talked a little together over it. And the gaudy woman wiped her eyes and sniffled on a tiny square of filmy, perfumed lace and passed little Mrs. Sommers her box of candy.\r\nThe play was over, the music ceased, the crowd filed out. It was like a dream ended. People scattered in all directions. Mrs. Sommers went to the corner and waited for the cable car.\r\nA man with keen eyes, who sat opposite to her, seemed to like the study of her small, pale face. It puzzled him to decipher what he saw there. In truth, he saw nothing-unless he were wizard enough to detect a poignant wish, a powerful longing that the cable car would never stop anywhere, but go on and on with her forever."}

He had a game leg and for this his friends called him Hoppy Holohan. He walked up and down constantly, stood by the hour at street corners arguing the point and made notes; but in the end it was Mrs Kearney who arranged everything.\r\n\r\nMiss Devlin had become Mrs Kearney out of spite. She had been educated in a high-class convent, where she had learned French and music. As she was naturally pale and unbending in manner she made few friends at school. When she came to the age of marriage she was sent out to many houses where her playing and ivory manners were much admired. She sat amid the chilly circle of her accomplishments, waiting for some suitor to brave it and offer her a brilliant life. But the young men whom she met were ordinary and she gave them no encouragement, trying to console her romantic desires by eating a great deal of Turkish Delight in secret. However, when she drew near the limit and her friends began to loosen their tongues about her, she silenced them by marrying Mr Kearney, who was a bootmaker on Ormond Quay.\r\n\r\nHe was much older than she. His conversation, which was serious, took place at intervals in his great brown beard. After the first year of married life, Mrs Kearney perceived that such a man would wear better than a romantic person, but she never put her own romantic ideas away. He was sober, thrifty and pious; he went to the altar every first Friday, sometimes with her, oftener by himself. But she never weakened in her religion and was a good wife to him. At some party in a strange house when she lifted her eyebrow ever so slightly he stood up to take his leave and, when his cough troubled him, she put the eider-down quilt over his feet and made a strong rum punch. For his part, he was a model father. By paying a small sum every week into a society, he ensured for both his daughters a dowry of one hundred pounds each when they came to the age of twenty-four. He sent the elder daughter, Kathleen, to a good convent, where she learned French and music, and afterward paid her fees at the Academy. Every year in the month of July Mrs Kearney found occasion to say to some friend:\r\n\r\n“My good man is packing us off to Skerries for a few weeks.”\r\n\r\nIf it was not Skerries it was Howth or Greystones.\r\n\r\nWhen the Irish Revival began to be appreciable Mrs Kearney determined to take advantage of her daughter’s name and brought an Irish teacher to the house. Kathleen and her sister sent Irish picture postcards to their friends and these friends sent back other Irish picture postcards. On special Sundays, when Mr Kearney went with his family to the pro-cathedral, a little crowd of people would assemble after mass at the corner of Cathedral Street. They were all friends of the Kearneys—musical friends or Nationalist friends; and, when they had played every little counter of gossip, they shook hands with one another all together, laughing at the crossing of so many hands, and said good-bye to one another in Irish. Soon the name of Miss Kathleen Kearney began to be heard often on people’s lips. People said that she was very clever at music and a very nice girl and, moreover, that she was a believer in the language movement. Mrs Kearney was well content at this. Therefore she was not surprised when one day Mr Holohan came to her and proposed that her daughter should be the accompanist at a series of four grand concerts which his Society was going to give in the Antient Concert Rooms. She brought him into the drawing-room, made him sit down and brought out the decanter and the silver biscuit-barrel. She entered heart and soul into the details of the enterprise, advised and dissuaded; and finally a contract was drawn up by which Kathleen was to receive eight guineas for her services as accompanist at the four grand concerts.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Holohan was a novice in such delicate matters as the wording of bills and the disposing of items for a programme, Mrs Kearney helped him. She had tact. She knew what artistes should go into capitals and what artistes should go into small type. She knew that the first tenor would not like to come on after Mr Meade’s comic turn. To keep the audience continually diverted she slipped the doubtful items in between the old favourites. Mr Holohan called to see her every day to have her advice on some point. She was invariably friendly and advising—homely, in fact. She pushed the decanter towards him, saying:\r\n\r\n“Now, help yourself, Mr Holohan!”\r\n\r\nAnd while he was helping himself she said:\r\n\r\n“Don’t be afraid! Don’t be afraid of it!”\r\n\r\nEverything went on smoothly. Mrs Kearney bought some lovely blush-pink charmeuse in Brown Thomas’s to let into the front of Kathleen’s dress. It cost a pretty penny; but there are occasions when a little expense is justifiable. She took a dozen of two-shilling tickets for the final concert and sent them to those friends who could not be trusted to come otherwise. She forgot nothing and, thanks to her, everything that was to be done was done.\r\n\r\nThe concerts were to be on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. When Mrs Kearney arrived with her daughter at the Antient Concert Rooms on Wednesday night she did not like the look of things. A few young men, wearing bright blue badges in their coats, stood idle in the vestibule; none of them wore evening dress. She passed by with her daughter and a quick glance through the open door of the hall showed her the cause of the stewards’ idleness. At first she wondered had she mistaken the hour. No, it was twenty minutes to eight.\r\n\r\nIn the dressing-room behind the stage she was introduced to the secretary of the Society, Mr Fitzpatrick. She smiled and shook his hand. He was a little man, with a white vacant face. She noticed that he wore his soft brown hat carelessly on the side of his head and that his accent was flat. He held a programme in his hand and, while he was talking to her, he chewed one end of it into a moist pulp. He seemed to bear disappointments lightly. Mr Holohan came into the dressing-room every few minutes with reports from the box-office. The artistes talked among themselves nervously, glanced from time to time at the mirror and rolled and unrolled their music. When it was nearly half-past eight, the few people in the hall began to express their desire to be entertained. Mr Fitzpatrick came in, smiled vacantly at the room, and said:\r\n\r\n“Well now, ladies and gentlemen. I suppose we’d better open the ball.”\r\n\r\nMrs Kearney rewarded his very flat final syllable with a quick stare of contempt, and then said to her daughter encouragingly:\r\n\r\n“Are you ready, dear?”\r\n\r\nWhen she had an opportunity, she called Mr Holohan aside and asked him to tell her what it meant. Mr Holohan did not know what it meant. He said that the Committee had made a mistake in arranging for four concerts: four was too many.\r\n\r\n“And the artistes!” said Mrs Kearney. “Of course they are doing their best, but really they are not good.”\r\n\r\nMr Holohan admitted that the artistes were no good but the Committee, he said, had decided to let the first three concerts go as they pleased and reserve all the talent for Saturday night. Mrs Kearney said nothing, but, as the mediocre items followed one another on the platform and the few people in the hall grew fewer and fewer, she began to regret that she had put herself to any expense for such a concert. There was something she didn’t like in the look of things and Mr Fitzpatrick’s vacant smile irritated her very much. However, she said nothing and waited to see how it would end. The concert expired shortly before ten, and everyone went home quickly.\r\n\r\nThe concert on Thursday night was better attended, but Mrs Kearney saw at once that the house was filled with paper. The audience behaved indecorously, as if the concert were an informal dress rehearsal. Mr Fitzpatrick seemed to enjoy himself; he was quite unconscious that Mrs Kearney was taking angry note of his conduct. He stood at the edge of the screen, from time to time jutting out his head and exchanging a laugh with two friends in the corner of the balcony. In the course of the evening, Mrs Kearney learned that the Friday concert was to be abandoned and that the Committee was going to move heaven and earth to secure a bumper house on Saturday night. When she heard this, she sought out Mr Holohan. She buttonholed him as he was limping out quickly with a glass of lemonade for a young lady and asked him was it true. Yes, it was true.\r\n\r\n“But, of course, that doesn’t alter the contract,” she said. “The contract was for four concerts.”\r\n\r\nMr Holohan seemed to be in a hurry; he advised her to speak to Mr Fitzpatrick. Mrs Kearney was now beginning to be alarmed. She called Mr Fitzpatrick away from his screen and told him that her daughter had signed for four concerts and that, of course, according to the terms of the contract, she should receive the sum originally stipulated for, whether the society gave the four concerts or not. Mr Fitzpatrick, who did not catch the point at issue very quickly, seemed unable to resolve the difficulty and said that he would bring the matter before the Committee. Mrs Kearney’s anger began to flutter in her cheek and she had all she could do to keep from asking:\r\n\r\n“And who is the Cometty pray?”\r\n\r\nBut she knew that it would not be ladylike to do that: so she was silent.\r\n\r\nLittle boys were sent out into the principal streets of Dublin early on Friday morning with bundles of handbills. Special puffs appeared in all the evening papers, reminding the music-loving public of the treat which was in store for it on the following evening. Mrs Kearney was somewhat reassured, but she thought well to tell her husband part of her suspicions. He listened carefully and said that perhaps it would be better if he went with her on Saturday night. She agreed. She respected her husband in the same way as she respected the General Post Office, as something large, secure and fixed; and though she knew the small number of his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male. She was glad that he had suggested coming with her. She thought her plans over.\r\n\r\nThe night of the grand concert came. Mrs Kearney, with her husband and daughter, arrived at the Antient Concert Rooms three-quarters of an hour before the time at which the concert was to begin. By ill luck it was a rainy evening. Mrs Kearney placed her daughter’s clothes and music in charge of her husband and went all over the building looking for Mr Holohan or Mr Fitzpatrick. She could find neither. She asked the stewards was any member of the Committee in the hall and, after a great deal of trouble, a steward brought out a little woman named Miss Beirne to whom Mrs Kearney explained that she wanted to see one of the secretaries. Miss Beirne expected them any minute and asked could she do anything. Mrs Kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face which was screwed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and answered:\r\n\r\n“No, thank you!”\r\n\r\nThe little woman hoped they would have a good house. She looked out at the rain until the melancholy of the wet street effaced all the trustfulness and enthusiasm from her twisted features. Then she gave a little sigh and said:\r\n\r\n“Ah, well! We did our best, the dear knows.”\r\n\r\nMrs Kearney had to go back to the dressing-room.\r\n\r\nThe artistes were arriving. The bass and the second tenor had already come. The bass, Mr Duggan, was a slender young man with a scattered black moustache. He was the son of a hall porter in an office in the city and, as a boy, he had sung prolonged bass notes in the resounding hall. From this humble state he had raised himself until he had become a first-rate artiste. He had appeared in grand opera. One night, when an operatic artiste had fallen ill, he had undertaken the part of the king in the opera of Maritana at the Queen’s Theatre. He sang his music with great feeling and volume and was warmly welcomed by the gallery; but, unfortunately, he marred the good impression by wiping his nose in his gloved hand once or twice out of thoughtlessness. He was unassuming and spoke little. He said yous so softly that it passed unnoticed and he never drank anything stronger than milk for his voice’s sake. Mr Bell, the second tenor, was a fair-haired little man who competed every year for prizes at the Feis Ceoil. On his fourth trial he had been awarded a bronze medal. He was extremely nervous and extremely jealous of other tenors and he covered his nervous jealousy with an ebullient friendliness. It was his humour to have people know what an ordeal a concert was to him. Therefore when he saw Mr Duggan he went over to him and asked:\r\n\r\n“Are you in it too?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mr Duggan.\r\n\r\nMr Bell laughed at his fellow-sufferer, held out his hand and said:\r\n\r\n“Shake!”\r\n\r\nMrs Kearney passed by these two young men and went to the edge of the screen to view the house. The seats were being filled up rapidly and a pleasant noise circulated in the auditorium. She came back and spoke to her husband privately. Their conversation was evidently about Kathleen for they both glanced at her often as she stood chatting to one of her Nationalist friends, Miss Healy, the contralto. An unknown solitary woman with a pale face walked through the room. The women followed with keen eyes the faded blue dress which was stretched upon a meagre body. Someone said that she was Madam Glynn, the soprano.\r\n\r\n“I wonder where did they dig her up,” said Kathleen to Miss Healy. “I’m sure I never heard of her.”\r\n\r\nMiss Healy had to smile. Mr Holohan limped into the dressing-room at that moment and the two young ladies asked him who was the unknown woman. Mr Holohan said that she was Madam Glynn from London. Madam Glynn took her stand in a corner of the room, holding a roll of music stiffly before her and from time to time changing the direction of her startled gaze. The shadow took her faded dress into shelter but fell revengefully into the little cup behind her collar-bone. The noise of the hall became more audible. The first tenor and the baritone arrived together. They were both well dressed, stout and complacent and they brought a breath of opulence among the company.\r\n\r\nMrs Kearney brought her daughter over to them, and talked to them amiably. She wanted to be on good terms with them but, while she strove to be polite, her eyes followed Mr Holohan in his limping and devious courses. As soon as she could she excused herself and went out after him.\r\n\r\n“Mr Holohan, I want to speak to you for a moment,” she said.\r\n\r\nThey went down to a discreet part of the corridor. Mrs Kearney asked him when was her daughter going to be paid. Mr Holohan said that Mr Fitzpatrick had charge of that. Mrs Kearney said that she didn’t know anything about Mr Fitzpatrick. Her daughter had signed a contract for eight guineas and she would have to be paid. Mr Holohan said that it wasn’t his business.\r\n\r\n“Why isn’t it your business?” asked Mrs Kearney. “Didn’t you yourself bring her the contract? Anyway, if it’s not your business it’s my business and I mean to see to it.”\r\n\r\n“You’d better speak to Mr Fitzpatrick,” said Mr Holohan distantly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know anything about Mr Fitzpatrick,” repeated Mrs Kearney. “I have my contract, and I intend to see that it is carried out.”\r\n\r\nWhen she came back to the dressing-room her cheeks were slightly suffused. The room was lively. Two men in outdoor dress had taken possession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with Miss Healy and the baritone. They were the Freeman man and Mr O’Madden Burke. The Freeman man had come in to say that he could not wait for the concert as he had to report the lecture which an American priest was giving in the Mansion House. He said they were to leave the report for him at the Freeman office and he would see that it went in. He was a grey-haired man, with a plausible voice and careful manners. He held an extinguished cigar in his hand and the aroma of cigar smoke floated near him. He had not intended to stay a moment because concerts and artistes bored him considerably but he remained leaning against the mantelpiece. Miss Healy stood in front of him, talking and laughing. He was old enough to suspect one reason for her politeness but young enough in spirit to turn the moment to account. The warmth, fragrance and colour of her body appealed to his senses. He was pleasantly conscious that the bosom which he saw rise and fall slowly beneath him rose and fell at that moment for him, that the laughter and fragrance and wilful glances were his tribute. When he could stay no longer he took leave of her regretfully.\r\n\r\n“O’Madden Burke will write the notice,” he explained to Mr Holohan, “and I’ll see it in.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much, Mr Hendrick,” said Mr Holohan, “you’ll see it in, I know. Now, won’t you have a little something before you go?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind,” said Mr Hendrick.\r\n\r\nThe two men went along some tortuous passages and up a dark staircase and came to a secluded room where one of the stewards was uncorking bottles for a few gentlemen. One of these gentlemen was Mr O’Madden Burke, who had found out the room by instinct. He was a suave, elderly man who balanced his imposing body, when at rest, upon a large silk umbrella. His magniloquent western name was the moral umbrella upon which he balanced the fine problem of his finances. He was widely respected.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr Holohan was entertaining the Freeman man Mrs Kearney was speaking so animatedly to her husband that he had to ask her to lower her voice. The conversation of the others in the dressing-room had become strained. Mr Bell, the first item, stood ready with his music but the accompanist made no sign. Evidently something was wrong. Mr Kearney looked straight before him, stroking his beard, while Mrs Kearney spoke into Kathleen’s ear with subdued emphasis. From the hall came sounds of encouragement, clapping and stamping of feet. The first tenor and the baritone and Miss Healy stood together, waiting tranquilly, but Mr Bell’s nerves were greatly agitated because he was afraid the audience would think that he had come late.\r\n\r\nMr Holohan and Mr O’Madden Burke came into the room. In a moment Mr Holohan perceived the hush. He went over to Mrs Kearney and spoke with her earnestly. While they were speaking the noise in the hall grew louder. Mr Holohan became very red and excited. He spoke volubly, but Mrs Kearney said curtly at intervals:\r\n\r\n“She won’t go on. She must get her eight guineas.”\r\n\r\nMr Holohan pointed desperately towards the hall where the audience was clapping and stamping. He appealed to Mr Kearney and to Kathleen. But Mr Kearney continued to stroke his beard and Kathleen looked down, moving the point of her new shoe: it was not her fault. Mrs Kearney repeated:\r\n\r\n“She won’t go on without her money.”\r\n\r\nAfter a swift struggle of tongues Mr Holohan hobbled out in haste. The room was silent. When the strain of the silence had become somewhat painful Miss Healy said to the baritone:\r\n\r\n“Have you seen Mrs Pat Campbell this week?”\r\n\r\nThe baritone had not seen her but he had been told that she was very fine. The conversation went no further. The first tenor bent his head and began to count the links of the gold chain which was extended across his waist, smiling and humming random notes to observe the effect on the frontal sinus. From time to time everyone glanced at Mrs Kearney.\r\n\r\nThe noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when Mr Fitzpatrick burst into the room, followed by Mr Holohan, who was panting. The clapping and stamping in the hall were punctuated by whistling. Mr Fitzpatrick held a few banknotes in his hand. He counted out four into Mrs Kearney’s hand and said she would get the other half at the interval. Mrs Kearney said:\r\n\r\n“This is four shillings short.”\r\n\r\nBut Kathleen gathered in her skirt and said: “Now, Mr Bell,” to the first item, who was shaking like an aspen. The singer and the accompanist went out together. The noise in hall died away. There was a pause of a few seconds: and then the piano was heard.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the concert was very successful except for Madam Glynn’s item. The poor lady sang Killarney in a bodiless gasping voice, with all the old-fashioned mannerisms of intonation and pronunciation which she believed lent elegance to her singing. She looked as if she had been resurrected from an old stage-wardrobe and the cheaper parts of the hall made fun of her high wailing notes. The first tenor and the contralto, however, brought down the house. Kathleen played a selection of Irish airs which was generously applauded. The first part closed with a stirring patriotic recitation delivered by a young lady who arranged amateur theatricals. It was deservedly applauded; and, when it was ended, the men went out for the interval, content.\r\n\r\nAll this time the dressing-room was a hive of excitement. In one corner were Mr Holohan, Mr Fitzpatrick, Miss Beirne, two of the stewards, the baritone, the bass, and Mr O’Madden Burke. Mr O’Madden Burke said it was the most scandalous exhibition he had ever witnessed. Miss Kathleen Kearney’s musical career was ended in Dublin after that, he said. The baritone was asked what did he think of Mrs Kearney’s conduct. He did not like to say anything. He had been paid his money and wished to be at peace with men. However, he said that Mrs Kearney might have taken the artistes into consideration. The stewards and the secretaries debated hotly as to what should be done when the interval came.\r\n\r\n“I agree with Miss Beirne,” said Mr O’Madden Burke. “Pay her nothing.”\r\n\r\nIn another corner of the room were Mrs Kearney and her husband, Mr Bell, Miss Healy and the young lady who had to recite the patriotic piece. Mrs Kearney said that the Committee had treated her scandalously. She had spared neither trouble nor expense and this was how she was repaid.\r\n\r\nThey thought they had only a girl to deal with and that, therefore, they could ride roughshod over her. But she would show them their mistake. They wouldn’t have dared to have treated her like that if she had been a man. But she would see that her daughter got her rights: she wouldn’t be fooled. If they didn’t pay her to the last farthing she would make Dublin ring. Of course she was sorry for the sake of the artistes. But what else could she do? She appealed to the second tenor who said he thought she had not been well treated. Then she appealed to Miss Healy. Miss Healy wanted to join the other group but she did not like to do so because she was a great friend of Kathleen’s and the Kearneys had often invited her to their house.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first part was ended Mr Fitzpatrick and Mr Holohan went over to Mrs Kearney and told her that the other four guineas would be paid after the Committee meeting on the following Tuesday and that, in case her daughter did not play for the second part, the Committee would consider the contract broken and would pay nothing.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t seen any Committee,” said Mrs Kearney angrily. “My daughter has her contract. She will get four pounds eight into her hand or a foot she won’t put on that platform.”\r\n\r\n“I’m surprised at you, Mrs Kearney,” said Mr Holohan. “I never thought you would treat us this way.”\r\n\r\n“And what way did you treat me?” asked Mrs Kearney.\r\n\r\nHer face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she would attack someone with her hands.\r\n\r\n“I’m asking for my rights.” she said.\r\n\r\n“You might have some sense of decency,” said Mr Holohan.\r\n\r\n“Might I, indeed?... And when I ask when my daughter is going to be paid I can’t get a civil answer.”\r\n\r\nShe tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice:\r\n\r\n“You must speak to the secretary. It’s not my business. I’m a great fellow fol-the-diddle-I-do.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you were a lady,” said Mr Holohan, walking away from her abruptly.\r\n\r\nAfter that Mrs Kearney’s conduct was condemned on all hands: everyone approved of what the Committee had done. She stood at the door, haggard with rage, arguing with her husband and daughter, gesticulating with them. She waited until it was time for the second part to begin in the hope that the secretaries would approach her. But Miss Healy had kindly consented to play one or two accompaniments. Mrs Kearney had to stand aside to allow the baritone and his accompanist to pass up to the platform. She stood still for an instant like an angry stone image and, when the first notes of the song struck her ear, she caught up her daughter’s cloak and said to her husband:\r\n\r\n“Get a cab!”\r\n\r\nHe went out at once. Mrs Kearney wrapped the cloak round her daughter and followed him. As she passed through the doorway she stopped and glared into Mr Holohan’s face.\r\n\r\n“I’m not done with you yet,” she said.\r\n\r\n“But I’m done with you,” said Mr Holohan.\r\n\r\nKathleen followed her mother meekly. Mr Holohan began to pace up and down the room, in order to cool himself for he felt his skin on fire.\r\n\r\n“That’s a nice lady!” he said. “O, she’s a nice lady!”\r\n\r\n“You did the proper thing, Holohan,” said Mr O’Madden Burke, poised upon his umbrella in approval."}

He had a game leg and for this his friends called him Hoppy Holohan. He walked up and down constantly, stood by the hour at street corners arguing the point and made notes; but in the end it was Mrs Kearney who arranged everything.\r\n\r\nMiss Devlin had become Mrs Kearney out of spite. She had been educated in a high-class convent, where she had learned French and music. As she was naturally pale and unbending in manner she made few friends at school. When she came to the age of marriage she was sent out to many houses where her playing and ivory manners were much admired. She sat amid the chilly circle of her accomplishments, waiting for some suitor to brave it and offer her a brilliant life. But the young men whom she met were ordinary and she gave them no encouragement, trying to console her romantic desires by eating a great deal of Turkish Delight in secret. However, when she drew near the limit and her friends began to loosen their tongues about her, she silenced them by marrying Mr Kearney, who was a bootmaker on Ormond Quay.\r\n\r\nHe was much older than she. His conversation, which was serious, took place at intervals in his great brown beard. After the first year of married life, Mrs Kearney perceived that such a man would wear better than a romantic person, but she never put her own romantic ideas away. He was sober, thrifty and pious; he went to the altar every first Friday, sometimes with her, oftener by himself. But she never weakened in her religion and was a good wife to him. At some party in a strange house when she lifted her eyebrow ever so slightly he stood up to take his leave and, when his cough troubled him, she put the eider-down quilt over his feet and made a strong rum punch. For his part, he was a model father. By paying a small sum every week into a society, he ensured for both his daughters a dowry of one hundred pounds each when they came to the age of twenty-four. He sent the elder daughter, Kathleen, to a good convent, where she learned French and music, and afterward paid her fees at the Academy. Every year in the month of July Mrs Kearney found occasion to say to some friend:\r\n\r\n“My good man is packing us off to Skerries for a few weeks.”\r\n\r\nIf it was not Skerries it was Howth or Greystones.\r\n\r\nWhen the Irish Revival began to be appreciable Mrs Kearney determined to take advantage of her daughter’s name and brought an Irish teacher to the house. Kathleen and her sister sent Irish picture postcards to their friends and these friends sent back other Irish picture postcards. On special Sundays, when Mr Kearney went with his family to the pro-cathedral, a little crowd of people would assemble after mass at the corner of Cathedral Street. They were all friends of the Kearneys—musical friends or Nationalist friends; and, when they had played every little counter of gossip, they shook hands with one another all together, laughing at the crossing of so many hands, and said good-bye to one another in Irish. Soon the name of Miss Kathleen Kearney began to be heard often on people’s lips. People said that she was very clever at music and a very nice girl and, moreover, that she was a believer in the language movement. Mrs Kearney was well content at this. Therefore she was not surprised when one day Mr Holohan came to her and proposed that her daughter should be the accompanist at a series of four grand concerts which his Society was going to give in the Antient Concert Rooms. She brought him into the drawing-room, made him sit down and brought out the decanter and the silver biscuit-barrel. She entered heart and soul into the details of the enterprise, advised and dissuaded; and finally a contract was drawn up by which Kathleen was to receive eight guineas for her services as accompanist at the four grand concerts.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Holohan was a novice in such delicate matters as the wording of bills and the disposing of items for a programme, Mrs Kearney helped him. She had tact. She knew what artistes should go into capitals and what artistes should go into small type. She knew that the first tenor would not like to come on after Mr Meade’s comic turn. To keep the audience continually diverted she slipped the doubtful items in between the old favourites. Mr Holohan called to see her every day to have her advice on some point. She was invariably friendly and advising—homely, in fact. She pushed the decanter towards him, saying:\r\n\r\n“Now, help yourself, Mr Holohan!”\r\n\r\nAnd while he was helping himself she said:\r\n\r\n“Don’t be afraid! Don’t be afraid of it!”\r\n\r\nEverything went on smoothly. Mrs Kearney bought some lovely blush-pink charmeuse in Brown Thomas’s to let into the front of Kathleen’s dress. It cost a pretty penny; but there are occasions when a little expense is justifiable. She took a dozen of two-shilling tickets for the final concert and sent them to those friends who could not be trusted to come otherwise. She forgot nothing and, thanks to her, everything that was to be done was done.\r\n\r\nThe concerts were to be on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. When Mrs Kearney arrived with her daughter at the Antient Concert Rooms on Wednesday night she did not like the look of things. A few young men, wearing bright blue badges in their coats, stood idle in the vestibule; none of them wore evening dress. She passed by with her daughter and a quick glance through the open door of the hall showed her the cause of the stewards’ idleness. At first she wondered had she mistaken the hour. No, it was twenty minutes to eight.\r\n\r\nIn the dressing-room behind the stage she was introduced to the secretary of the Society, Mr Fitzpatrick. She smiled and shook his hand. He was a little man, with a white vacant face. She noticed that he wore his soft brown hat carelessly on the side of his head and that his accent was flat. He held a programme in his hand and, while he was talking to her, he chewed one end of it into a moist pulp. He seemed to bear disappointments lightly. Mr Holohan came into the dressing-room every few minutes with reports from the box-office. The artistes talked among themselves nervously, glanced from time to time at the mirror and rolled and unrolled their music. When it was nearly half-past eight, the few people in the hall began to express their desire to be entertained. Mr Fitzpatrick came in, smiled vacantly at the room, and said:\r\n\r\n“Well now, ladies and gentlemen. I suppose we’d better open the ball.”\r\n\r\nMrs Kearney rewarded his very flat final syllable with a quick stare of contempt, and then said to her daughter encouragingly:\r\n\r\n“Are you ready, dear?”\r\n\r\nWhen she had an opportunity, she called Mr Holohan aside and asked him to tell her what it meant. Mr Holohan did not know what it meant. He said that the Committee had made a mistake in arranging for four concerts: four was too many.\r\n\r\n“And the artistes!” said Mrs Kearney. “Of course they are doing their best, but really they are not good.”\r\n\r\nMr Holohan admitted that the artistes were no good but the Committee, he said, had decided to let the first three concerts go as they pleased and reserve all the talent for Saturday night. Mrs Kearney said nothing, but, as the mediocre items followed one another on the platform and the few people in the hall grew fewer and fewer, she began to regret that she had put herself to any expense for such a concert. There was something she didn’t like in the look of things and Mr Fitzpatrick’s vacant smile irritated her very much. However, she said nothing and waited to see how it would end. The concert expired shortly before ten, and everyone went home quickly.\r\n\r\nThe concert on Thursday night was better attended, but Mrs Kearney saw at once that the house was filled with paper. The audience behaved indecorously, as if the concert were an informal dress rehearsal. Mr Fitzpatrick seemed to enjoy himself; he was quite unconscious that Mrs Kearney was taking angry note of his conduct. He stood at the edge of the screen, from time to time jutting out his head and exchanging a laugh with two friends in the corner of the balcony. In the course of the evening, Mrs Kearney learned that the Friday concert was to be abandoned and that the Committee was going to move heaven and earth to secure a bumper house on Saturday night. When she heard this, she sought out Mr Holohan. She buttonholed him as he was limping out quickly with a glass of lemonade for a young lady and asked him was it true. Yes, it was true.\r\n\r\n“But, of course, that doesn’t alter the contract,” she said. “The contract was for four concerts.”\r\n\r\nMr Holohan seemed to be in a hurry; he advised her to speak to Mr Fitzpatrick. Mrs Kearney was now beginning to be alarmed. She called Mr Fitzpatrick away from his screen and told him that her daughter had signed for four concerts and that, of course, according to the terms of the contract, she should receive the sum originally stipulated for, whether the society gave the four concerts or not. Mr Fitzpatrick, who did not catch the point at issue very quickly, seemed unable to resolve the difficulty and said that he would bring the matter before the Committee. Mrs Kearney’s anger began to flutter in her cheek and she had all she could do to keep from asking:\r\n\r\n“And who is the Cometty pray?”\r\n\r\nBut she knew that it would not be ladylike to do that: so she was silent.\r\n\r\nLittle boys were sent out into the principal streets of Dublin early on Friday morning with bundles of handbills. Special puffs appeared in all the evening papers, reminding the music-loving public of the treat which was in store for it on the following evening. Mrs Kearney was somewhat reassured, but she thought well to tell her husband part of her suspicions. He listened carefully and said that perhaps it would be better if he went with her on Saturday night. She agreed. She respected her husband in the same way as she respected the General Post Office, as something large, secure and fixed; and though she knew the small number of his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male. She was glad that he had suggested coming with her. She thought her plans over.\r\n\r\nThe night of the grand concert came. Mrs Kearney, with her husband and daughter, arrived at the Antient Concert Rooms three-quarters of an hour before the time at which the concert was to begin. By ill luck it was a rainy evening. Mrs Kearney placed her daughter’s clothes and music in charge of her husband and went all over the building looking for Mr Holohan or Mr Fitzpatrick. She could find neither. She asked the stewards was any member of the Committee in the hall and, after a great deal of trouble, a steward brought out a little woman named Miss Beirne to whom Mrs Kearney explained that she wanted to see one of the secretaries. Miss Beirne expected them any minute and asked could she do anything. Mrs Kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face which was screwed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and answered:\r\n\r\n“No, thank you!”\r\n\r\nThe little woman hoped they would have a good house. She looked out at the rain until the melancholy of the wet street effaced all the trustfulness and enthusiasm from her twisted features. Then she gave a little sigh and said:\r\n\r\n“Ah, well! We did our best, the dear knows.”\r\n\r\nMrs Kearney had to go back to the dressing-room.\r\n\r\nThe artistes were arriving. The bass and the second tenor had already come. The bass, Mr Duggan, was a slender young man with a scattered black moustache. He was the son of a hall porter in an office in the city and, as a boy, he had sung prolonged bass notes in the resounding hall. From this humble state he had raised himself until he had become a first-rate artiste. He had appeared in grand opera. One night, when an operatic artiste had fallen ill, he had undertaken the part of the king in the opera of Maritana at the Queen’s Theatre. He sang his music with great feeling and volume and was warmly welcomed by the gallery; but, unfortunately, he marred the good impression by wiping his nose in his gloved hand once or twice out of thoughtlessness. He was unassuming and spoke little. He said yous so softly that it passed unnoticed and he never drank anything stronger than milk for his voice’s sake. Mr Bell, the second tenor, was a fair-haired little man who competed every year for prizes at the Feis Ceoil. On his fourth trial he had been awarded a bronze medal. He was extremely nervous and extremely jealous of other tenors and he covered his nervous jealousy with an ebullient friendliness. It was his humour to have people know what an ordeal a concert was to him. Therefore when he saw Mr Duggan he went over to him and asked:\r\n\r\n“Are you in it too?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mr Duggan.\r\n\r\nMr Bell laughed at his fellow-sufferer, held out his hand and said:\r\n\r\n“Shake!”\r\n\r\nMrs Kearney passed by these two young men and went to the edge of the screen to view the house. The seats were being filled up rapidly and a pleasant noise circulated in the auditorium. She came back and spoke to her husband privately. Their conversation was evidently about Kathleen for they both glanced at her often as she stood chatting to one of her Nationalist friends, Miss Healy, the contralto. An unknown solitary woman with a pale face walked through the room. The women followed with keen eyes the faded blue dress which was stretched upon a meagre body. Someone said that she was Madam Glynn, the soprano.\r\n\r\n“I wonder where did they dig her up,” said Kathleen to Miss Healy. “I’m sure I never heard of her.”\r\n\r\nMiss Healy had to smile. Mr Holohan limped into the dressing-room at that moment and the two young ladies asked him who was the unknown woman. Mr Holohan said that she was Madam Glynn from London. Madam Glynn took her stand in a corner of the room, holding a roll of music stiffly before her and from time to time changing the direction of her startled gaze. The shadow took her faded dress into shelter but fell revengefully into the little cup behind her collar-bone. The noise of the hall became more audible. The first tenor and the baritone arrived together. They were both well dressed, stout and complacent and they brought a breath of opulence among the company.\r\n\r\nMrs Kearney brought her daughter over to them, and talked to them amiably. She wanted to be on good terms with them but, while she strove to be polite, her eyes followed Mr Holohan in his limping and devious courses. As soon as she could she excused herself and went out after him.\r\n\r\n“Mr Holohan, I want to speak to you for a moment,” she said.\r\n\r\nThey went down to a discreet part of the corridor. Mrs Kearney asked him when was her daughter going to be paid. Mr Holohan said that Mr Fitzpatrick had charge of that. Mrs Kearney said that she didn’t know anything about Mr Fitzpatrick. Her daughter had signed a contract for eight guineas and she would have to be paid. Mr Holohan said that it wasn’t his business.\r\n\r\n“Why isn’t it your business?” asked Mrs Kearney. “Didn’t you yourself bring her the contract? Anyway, if it’s not your business it’s my business and I mean to see to it.”\r\n\r\n“You’d better speak to Mr Fitzpatrick,” said Mr Holohan distantly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know anything about Mr Fitzpatrick,” repeated Mrs Kearney. “I have my contract, and I intend to see that it is carried out.”\r\n\r\nWhen she came back to the dressing-room her cheeks were slightly suffused. The room was lively. Two men in outdoor dress had taken possession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with Miss Healy and the baritone. They were the Freeman man and Mr O’Madden Burke. The Freeman man had come in to say that he could not wait for the concert as he had to report the lecture which an American priest was giving in the Mansion House. He said they were to leave the report for him at the Freeman office and he would see that it went in. He was a grey-haired man, with a plausible voice and careful manners. He held an extinguished cigar in his hand and the aroma of cigar smoke floated near him. He had not intended to stay a moment because concerts and artistes bored him considerably but he remained leaning against the mantelpiece. Miss Healy stood in front of him, talking and laughing. He was old enough to suspect one reason for her politeness but young enough in spirit to turn the moment to account. The warmth, fragrance and colour of her body appealed to his senses. He was pleasantly conscious that the bosom which he saw rise and fall slowly beneath him rose and fell at that moment for him, that the laughter and fragrance and wilful glances were his tribute. When he could stay no longer he took leave of her regretfully.\r\n\r\n“O’Madden Burke will write the notice,” he explained to Mr Holohan, “and I’ll see it in.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much, Mr Hendrick,” said Mr Holohan, “you’ll see it in, I know. Now, won’t you have a little something before you go?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind,” said Mr Hendrick.\r\n\r\nThe two men went along some tortuous passages and up a dark staircase and came to a secluded room where one of the stewards was uncorking bottles for a few gentlemen. One of these gentlemen was Mr O’Madden Burke, who had found out the room by instinct. He was a suave, elderly man who balanced his imposing body, when at rest, upon a large silk umbrella. His magniloquent western name was the moral umbrella upon which he balanced the fine problem of his finances. He was widely respected.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr Holohan was entertaining the Freeman man Mrs Kearney was speaking so animatedly to her husband that he had to ask her to lower her voice. The conversation of the others in the dressing-room had become strained. Mr Bell, the first item, stood ready with his music but the accompanist made no sign. Evidently something was wrong. Mr Kearney looked straight before him, stroking his beard, while Mrs Kearney spoke into Kathleen’s ear with subdued emphasis. From the hall came sounds of encouragement, clapping and stamping of feet. The first tenor and the baritone and Miss Healy stood together, waiting tranquilly, but Mr Bell’s nerves were greatly agitated because he was afraid the audience would think that he had come late.\r\n\r\nMr Holohan and Mr O’Madden Burke came into the room. In a moment Mr Holohan perceived the hush. He went over to Mrs Kearney and spoke with her earnestly. While they were speaking the noise in the hall grew louder. Mr Holohan became very red and excited. He spoke volubly, but Mrs Kearney said curtly at intervals:\r\n\r\n“She won’t go on. She must get her eight guineas.”\r\n\r\nMr Holohan pointed desperately towards the hall where the audience was clapping and stamping. He appealed to Mr Kearney and to Kathleen. But Mr Kearney continued to stroke his beard and Kathleen looked down, moving the point of her new shoe: it was not her fault. Mrs Kearney repeated:\r\n\r\n“She won’t go on without her money.”\r\n\r\nAfter a swift struggle of tongues Mr Holohan hobbled out in haste. The room was silent. When the strain of the silence had become somewhat painful Miss Healy said to the baritone:\r\n\r\n“Have you seen Mrs Pat Campbell this week?”\r\n\r\nThe baritone had not seen her but he had been told that she was very fine. The conversation went no further. The first tenor bent his head and began to count the links of the gold chain which was extended across his waist, smiling and humming random notes to observe the effect on the frontal sinus. From time to time everyone glanced at Mrs Kearney.\r\n\r\nThe noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when Mr Fitzpatrick burst into the room, followed by Mr Holohan, who was panting. The clapping and stamping in the hall were punctuated by whistling. Mr Fitzpatrick held a few banknotes in his hand. He counted out four into Mrs Kearney’s hand and said she would get the other half at the interval. Mrs Kearney said:\r\n\r\n“This is four shillings short.”\r\n\r\nBut Kathleen gathered in her skirt and said: “Now, Mr Bell,” to the first item, who was shaking like an aspen. The singer and the accompanist went out together. The noise in hall died away. There was a pause of a few seconds: and then the piano was heard.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the concert was very successful except for Madam Glynn’s item. The poor lady sang Killarney in a bodiless gasping voice, with all the old-fashioned mannerisms of intonation and pronunciation which she believed lent elegance to her singing. She looked as if she had been resurrected from an old stage-wardrobe and the cheaper parts of the hall made fun of her high wailing notes. The first tenor and the contralto, however, brought down the house. Kathleen played a selection of Irish airs which was generously applauded. The first part closed with a stirring patriotic recitation delivered by a young lady who arranged amateur theatricals. It was deservedly applauded; and, when it was ended, the men went out for the interval, content.\r\n\r\nAll this time the dressing-room was a hive of excitement. In one corner were Mr Holohan, Mr Fitzpatrick, Miss Beirne, two of the stewards, the baritone, the bass, and Mr O’Madden Burke. Mr O’Madden Burke said it was the most scandalous exhibition he had ever witnessed. Miss Kathleen Kearney’s musical career was ended in Dublin after that, he said. The baritone was asked what did he think of Mrs Kearney’s conduct. He did not like to say anything. He had been paid his money and wished to be at peace with men. However, he said that Mrs Kearney might have taken the artistes into consideration. The stewards and the secretaries debated hotly as to what should be done when the interval came.\r\n\r\n“I agree with Miss Beirne,” said Mr O’Madden Burke. “Pay her nothing.”\r\n\r\nIn another corner of the room were Mrs Kearney and her husband, Mr Bell, Miss Healy and the young lady who had to recite the patriotic piece. Mrs Kearney said that the Committee had treated her scandalously. She had spared neither trouble nor expense and this was how she was repaid.\r\n\r\nThey thought they had only a girl to deal with and that, therefore, they could ride roughshod over her. But she would show them their mistake. They wouldn’t have dared to have treated her like that if she had been a man. But she would see that her daughter got her rights: she wouldn’t be fooled. If they didn’t pay her to the last farthing she would make Dublin ring. Of course she was sorry for the sake of the artistes. But what else could she do? She appealed to the second tenor who said he thought she had not been well treated. Then she appealed to Miss Healy. Miss Healy wanted to join the other group but she did not like to do so because she was a great friend of Kathleen’s and the Kearneys had often invited her to their house.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first part was ended Mr Fitzpatrick and Mr Holohan went over to Mrs Kearney and told her that the other four guineas would be paid after the Committee meeting on the following Tuesday and that, in case her daughter did not play for the second part, the Committee would consider the contract broken and would pay nothing.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t seen any Committee,” said Mrs Kearney angrily. “My daughter has her contract. She will get four pounds eight into her hand or a foot she won’t put on that platform.”\r\n\r\n“I’m surprised at you, Mrs Kearney,” said Mr Holohan. “I never thought you would treat us this way.”\r\n\r\n“And what way did you treat me?” asked Mrs Kearney.\r\n\r\nHer face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she would attack someone with her hands.\r\n\r\n“I’m asking for my rights.” she said.\r\n\r\n“You might have some sense of decency,” said Mr Holohan.\r\n\r\n“Might I, indeed?... And when I ask when my daughter is going to be paid I can’t get a civil answer.”\r\n\r\nShe tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice:\r\n\r\n“You must speak to the secretary. It’s not my business. I’m a great fellow fol-the-diddle-I-do.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you were a lady,” said Mr Holohan, walking away from her abruptly.\r\n\r\nAfter that Mrs Kearney’s conduct was condemned on all hands: everyone approved of what the Committee had done. She stood at the door, haggard with rage, arguing with her husband and daughter, gesticulating with them. She waited until it was time for the second part to begin in the hope that the secretaries would approach her. But Miss Healy had kindly consented to play one or two accompaniments. Mrs Kearney had to stand aside to allow the baritone and his accompanist to pass up to the platform. She stood still for an instant like an angry stone image and, when the first notes of the song struck her ear, she caught up her daughter’s cloak and said to her husband:\r\n\r\n“Get a cab!”\r\n\r\nHe went out at once. Mrs Kearney wrapped the cloak round her daughter and followed him. As she passed through the doorway she stopped and glared into Mr Holohan’s face.\r\n\r\n“I’m not done with you yet,” she said.\r\n\r\n“But I’m done with you,” said Mr Holohan.\r\n\r\nKathleen followed her mother meekly. Mr Holohan began to pace up and down the room, in order to cool himself for he felt his skin on fire.\r\n\r\n“That’s a nice lady!” he said. “O, she’s a nice lady!”\r\n\r\n“You did the proper thing, Holohan,” said Mr O’Madden Burke, poised upon his umbrella in approval."], ["snippet", "Mr Holohan, assistant secretary of the Eire Abu Society, had been walking up and down Dublin for nearly a month, with his hands and pockets full of dirty pieces of paper, arranging about the series of concerts. He had a game leg and for this his friends called him Hoppy Holohan. He walked up and down constantly, stood by the hour at street corners arguing the point and made notes; but in the end it was Mrs Kearney who arranged everything.\r\n\r\nMiss Devlin had become Mrs Kearney out of spite. She had been educated in a high-class convent, where she had learned French and music. As she was naturally pale and unbending in manner she made few friends at school.

And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.\r\nThere was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.\r\nWhile the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.\r\nIn the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name “Mr. James Dillingham Young.”\r\nThe “Dillingham” had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, though, they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called “Jim” and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.\r\nDella finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn’t go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling—something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.\r\nThere was a pier glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.\r\nSuddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.\r\nNow, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim’s gold watch that had been his father’s and his grandfather’s. The other was Della’s hair. Had the queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty’s jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.\r\nSo now Della’s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.\r\nOn went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street.\r\nWhere she stopped the sign read: “Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds.” One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the “Sofronie.”\r\n“Will you buy my hair?” asked Della.\r\n“I buy hair,” said Madame. “Take yer hat off and let’s have a sight at the looks of it.”\r\nDown rippled the brown cascade.\r\n“Twenty dollars,” said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.\r\n“Give it to me quick,” said Della.\r\nOh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim’s present.\r\nShe found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation—as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim’s. It was like him. Quietness and value—the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.\r\nWhen Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends—a mammoth task.\r\nWithin forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.\r\n“If Jim doesn’t kill me,” she said to herself, “before he takes a second look at me, he’ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do—oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?”\r\nAt 7 o’clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.\r\nJim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying a little silent prayer about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: “Please God, make him think I am still pretty.”\r\nThe door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two—and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.\r\nJim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.\r\nDella wriggled off the table and went for him.\r\n“Jim, darling,” she cried, “don’t look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold because I couldn’t have lived through Christmas without giving you a present. It’ll grow out again—you won’t mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say ‘Merry Christmas!’ Jim, and let’s be happy. You don’t know what a nice—what a beautiful, nice gift I’ve got for you.”\r\n“You’ve cut off your hair?” asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor.\r\n“Cut it off and sold it,” said Della. “Don’t you like me just as well, anyhow? I’m me without my hair, ain’t I?”\r\nJim looked about the room curiously.\r\n“You say your hair is gone?” he said, with an air almost of idiocy.\r\n“You needn’t look for it,” said Della. “It’s sold, I tell you—sold and gone, too. It’s Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,” she went on with sudden serious sweetness, “but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?”\r\nOut of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year—what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.\r\nJim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.\r\n“Don’t make any mistake, Dell,” he said, “about me. I don’t think there’s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you’ll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first.”\r\nWhite fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.\r\nFor there lay The Combs—the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jewelled rims—just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.\r\nBut she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: “My hair grows so fast, Jim!”\r\nAnd then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, “Oh, oh!”\r\nJim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.\r\n“Isn’t it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You’ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it.”\r\nInstead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.\r\n“Dell,” said he, “let’s put our Christmas presents away and keep ’em a while. They’re too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.”\r\nThe magi, as you know, were wise men—wonderfully wise men—who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi. "}

Henry"], ["title", "The Gift of The Magi"], ["content", "One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.\r\nThere was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.\r\nWhile the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.\r\nIn the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name “Mr. James Dillingham Young.”\r\nThe “Dillingham” had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, though, they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called “Jim” and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.\r\nDella finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn’t go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling—something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.\r\nThere was a pier glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.\r\nSuddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.\r\nNow, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim’s gold watch that had been his father’s and his grandfather’s. The other was Della’s hair. Had the queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty’s jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.\r\nSo now Della’s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.\r\nOn went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street.\r\nWhere she stopped the sign read: “Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds.” One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the “Sofronie.”\r\n“Will you buy my hair?” asked Della.\r\n“I buy hair,” said Madame. “Take yer hat off and let’s have a sight at the looks of it.”\r\nDown rippled the brown cascade.\r\n“Twenty dollars,” said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.\r\n“Give it to me quick,” said Della.\r\nOh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim’s present.\r\nShe found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation—as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim’s. It was like him. Quietness and value—the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.\r\nWhen Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends—a mammoth task.\r\nWithin forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.\r\n“If Jim doesn’t kill me,” she said to herself, “before he takes a second look at me, he’ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do—oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?”\r\nAt 7 o’clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.\r\nJim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying a little silent prayer about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: “Please God, make him think I am still pretty.”\r\nThe door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two—and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.\r\nJim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.\r\nDella wriggled off the table and went for him.\r\n“Jim, darling,” she cried, “don’t look at me that way.

I’m me without my hair, ain’t I?”\r\nJim looked about the room curiously.\r\n“You say your hair is gone?” he said, with an air almost of idiocy.\r\n“You needn’t look for it,” said Della. “It’s sold, I tell you—sold and gone, too.

This was why the young man who opened the sagging gate could not see that it was boarded up, and did not cease his cheerful whistling until he had pressed through the crowding trees and found himself almost on the sunken stone doorstep over which in olden days honeysuckle had been wont to arch. Now only a few straggling, uncared-for vines clung forlornly to the shingles, and the windows were, as has been said, all boarded up.\r\n\r\nThe whistle died on the young man's lips and an expression of blank astonishment and dismay settled down on his face—a good, kindly, honest face it was, although perhaps it did not betoken any pronounced mental gifts on the part of its owner.\r\n\r\n\"What can have happened?\" he said to himself. \"Uncle Tom and Aunt Sally can't be dead—I'd have seen their deaths in the paper if they was. And I'd a-thought if they'd moved away it'd been printed too. They can't have been gone long—that flower-bed must have been made up last spring. Well, this is a kind of setback for a fellow. Here I've been tramping all the way from the station, a-thinking how good it would be to see Aunt Sally's sweet old face again, and hear Uncle Tom's laugh, and all I find is a boarded-up house going to seed. S'pose I might as well toddle over to Stetsons' and inquire if they haven't disappeared, too.\"\r\n\r\nHe went through the old firs back of the lot and across the field to a rather shabby house beyond. A cheery-faced woman answered his knock and looked at him in a puzzled fashion. \"Have you forgot me, Mrs. Stetson? Don't you remember Lovell Stevens and how you used to give him plum tarts when he'd bring your turkeys home?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stetson caught both his hands in a hearty clasp.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I haven't forgotten!\" she declared. \"Well, well, and you're Lovell! I think I ought to know your face, though you've changed a lot. Fifteen years have made a big difference in you. Come right in. Pa, this is Lovell—you mind Lovell, the boy Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom had for years?\"\r\n\r\n\"Reckon I do,\" drawled Jonah Stetson with a friendly grin. \"Ain't likely to forget some of the capers you used to be cutting up. You've filled out considerable. Where have you been for the last ten years? Aunt Sally fretted a lot over you, thinking you was dead or gone to the bad.\"\r\n\r\nLovell's face clouded.\r\n\r\n\"I know I ought to have written,\" he said repentantly, \"but you know I'm a terrible poor scholar, and I'd do most anything than try to write a letter. But where's Uncle Tom and Aunt Sally gone? Surely they ain't dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jonah Stetson slowly, \"no—but I guess they'd rather be. They're in the poorhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"The poorhouse! Aunt Sally in the poorhouse!\" exclaimed Lovell.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and it's a burning shame,\" declared Mrs. Stetson. \"Aunt Sally's just breaking her heart from the disgrace of it. But it didn't seem as if it could be helped. Uncle Tom got so crippled with rheumatism he couldn't work and Aunt Sally was too frail to do anything. They hadn't any relations and there was a mortgage on the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"There wasn't any when I went away.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; they had to borrow money six years ago when Uncle Tom had his first spell of rheumatic fever. This spring it was clear that there was nothing for them but the poorhouse. They went three months ago and terrible hard they took it, especially Aunt Sally, I felt awful about it myself. Jonah and I would have took them if we could, but we just couldn't—we've nothing but Jonah's wages and we have eight children and not a bit of spare room. I go over to see Aunt Sally as often as I can and take her some little thing, but I dunno's she wouldn't rather not see anybody than see them in the poorhouse.\"\r\n\r\nLovell weighed his hat in his hands and frowned over it reflectively.\r\n\r\n\"Who owns the house now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Peter Townley. He held the mortgage. And all the old furniture was sold too, and that most killed Aunt Sally. But do you know what she's fretting over most of all? She and Uncle Tom will have been married fifty years in a fortnight's time and Aunt Sally thinks it's awful to have to spend their golden wedding anniversary in the poorhouse. She talks about it all the time. You're not going, Lovell\"—for Lovell had risen—\"you must stop with us, since your old home is closed up. We'll scare you up a shakedown to sleep on and you're welcome as welcome. I haven't forgot the time you caught Mary Ellen just as she was tumbling into the well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, I'll stay to tea,\" said Lovell, sitting down again, \"but I guess I'll make my headquarters up at the station hotel as long as I stay round here. It's kind of more central.\"\r\n\r\n\"Got on pretty well out west, hey?\" queried Jonah.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty well for a fellow who had nothing but his two hands to depend on when he went out,\" said Lovell cautiously. \"I've only been a labouring man, of course, but I've saved up enough to start a little store when I go back. That's why I came east for a trip now—before I'd be tied down to business. I was hankering to see Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom once more. I'll never forget how kind and good they was to me. There I was, when Dad died, a little sinner of eleven, just heading for destruction. They give me a home and all the schooling I ever had and all the love I ever got. It was Aunt Sally's teachings made as much a man of me as I am. I never forgot 'em and I've tried to live up to 'em.\"\r\n\r\nAfter tea Lovell said he thought he'd stroll up the road and pay Peter Townley a call. Jonah Stetson and his wife looked at each other when he had gone.\r\n\r\n\"Got something in his eye,\" nodded Jonah. \"Him and Peter weren't never much of friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe Aunt Sally's bread is coming back to her after all,\" said his wife. \"People used to be hard on Lovell. But I always liked him and I'm real glad he's turned out so well.\"\r\n\r\nLovell came back to the Stetsons' the next evening. In the interval he had seen Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom. The meeting had been both glad and sad. Lovell had also seen other people.\r\n\r\n\"I've bought Uncle Tom's old house from Peter Townley,\" he said quietly, \"and I want you folks to help me out with my plans. Uncle Tom and Aunt Sally ain't going to spend their golden wedding in the poorhouse—no, sir. They'll spend it in their own home with their old friends about them. But they're not to know anything about it till the very night. Do you s'pose any of the old furniture could be got back?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe every stick of it could,\" said Mrs. Stetson excitedly. \"Most of it was bought by folks living handy and I don't believe one of them would refuse to sell it back. Uncle Tom's old chair is here to begin with—Aunt Sally give me that herself. She said she couldn't bear to have it sold. Mrs. Isaac Appleby at the station bought the set of pink-sprigged china and James Parker bought the grandfather's clock and the whatnot is at the Stanton Grays'.\"\r\n\r\nFor the next fortnight Lovell and Mrs. Stetson did so much travelling round together that Jonah said genially he might as well be a bachelor as far as meals and buttons went. They visited every house where a bit of Aunt Sally's belongings could be found. Very successful they were too, and at the end of their jaunting the interior of the little house behind the apple trees looked very much as it had looked when Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom lived there.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Stetson had been revolving a design in her mind, and one afternoon she did some canvassing on her own account. The next time she saw Lovell she said:\r\n\r\n\"We ain't going to let you do it all. The women folks around here are going to furnish the refreshments for the golden wedding and the girls are going to decorate the house with golden rod.\"\r\n\r\nThe evening of the wedding anniversary came. Everybody in Blair was in the plot, including the matron of the poorhouse. That night Aunt Sally watched the sunset over the hills through bitter tears.\r\n\r\n\"I never thought I'd be celebrating my golden wedding in the poorhouse,\" she sobbed. Uncle Tom put his twisted hand on her shaking old shoulder, but before he could utter any words of comfort Lovell Stevens stood before them.\r\n\r\n\"Just get your bonnet on, Aunt Sally,\" he cried jovially, \"and both of you come along with me. I've got a buggy here for you ... and you might as well say goodbye to this place, for you're not coming back to it any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lovell, oh, what do you mean?\" said Aunt Sally tremulously.\r\n\r\n\"I'll explain what I mean as we drive along. Hurry up—the folks are waiting.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the little old house, it was all aglow with light. Aunt Sally gave a cry as she entered it. All her old household goods were back in their places. There were some new ones too, for Lovell had supplied all that was lacking. The house was full of their old friends and neighbours. Mrs. Stetson welcomed them home again.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tom,\" whispered Aunt Sally, tears of happiness streaming down her old face, \"oh, Tom, isn't God good?\"\r\n\r\nThey had a right royal celebration, and a supper such as the Blair housewives could produce. There were speeches and songs and tales. Lovell kept himself in the background and helped Mrs. Stetson cut cake in the pantry all the evening. But when the guests had gone, he went to Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom, who were sitting by the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Here's a little golden wedding present for you,\" he said awkwardly, putting a purse into Aunt Sally's hand. \"I reckon there's enough there to keep you from ever having to go to the poorhouse again and if not, there'll be more where that comes from when it's done.\"\r\n\r\nThere were twenty-five bright twenty-dollar gold pieces in the purse.\r\n\r\n\"We can't take it, Lovell,\" protested Aunt Sally. \"You can't afford it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you worry about that,\" laughed Lovell. \"Out west men don't think much of a little wad like that. I owe you far more than can be paid in cash, Aunt Sally. You must take it—I want to know there's a little home here for me and two kind hearts in it, no matter where I roam.\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, Lovell,\" said Uncle Tom huskily. \"You don't know what you've done for Sally and me.\"\r\n\r\nThat night, when Lovell went to the little bedroom off the parlour—for Aunt Sally, rejoicing in the fact that she was again mistress of a spare room, would not hear of his going to the station hotel—he gazed at his reflection in the gilt-framed mirror soberly.\r\n\r\n\"You've just got enough left to pay your passage back west, old fellow,\" he said, \"and then it's begin all over again just where you begun before. But Aunt Sally's face was worth it all—yes, sir. And you've got your two hands still and an old couple's prayers and blessings. Not such a bad capital, Lovell, not such a bad capital.\""}

M. Montgomery"], ["title", "A Golden Wedding"], ["content", "The land dropped abruptly down from the gate, and a thick, shrubby growth of young apple orchard almost hid the little weather-grey house from the road. This was why the young man who opened the sagging gate could not see that it was boarded up, and did not cease his cheerful whistling until he had pressed through the crowding trees and found himself almost on the sunken stone doorstep over which in olden days honeysuckle had been wont to arch. Now only a few straggling, uncared-for vines clung forlornly to the shingles, and the windows were, as has been said, all boarded up.\r\n\r\nThe whistle died on the young man's lips and an expression of blank astonishment and dismay settled down on his face—a good, kindly, honest face it was, although perhaps it did not betoken any pronounced mental gifts on the part of its owner.\r\n\r\n\"What can have happened?\" he said to himself. \"Uncle Tom and Aunt Sally can't be dead—I'd have seen their deaths in the paper if they was. And I'd a-thought if they'd moved away it'd been printed too. They can't have been gone long—that flower-bed must have been made up last spring. Well, this is a kind of setback for a fellow. Here I've been tramping all the way from the station, a-thinking how good it would be to see Aunt Sally's sweet old face again, and hear Uncle Tom's laugh, and all I find is a boarded-up house going to seed. S'pose I might as well toddle over to Stetsons' and inquire if they haven't disappeared, too.\"\r\n\r\nHe went through the old firs back of the lot and across the field to a rather shabby house beyond. A cheery-faced woman answered his knock and looked at him in a puzzled fashion. \"Have you forgot me, Mrs. Stetson? Don't you remember Lovell Stevens and how you used to give him plum tarts when he'd bring your turkeys home?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stetson caught both his hands in a hearty clasp.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I haven't forgotten!\" she declared. \"Well, well, and you're Lovell! I think I ought to know your face, though you've changed a lot. Fifteen years have made a big difference in you. Come right in. Pa, this is Lovell—you mind Lovell, the boy Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom had for years?\"\r\n\r\n\"Reckon I do,\" drawled Jonah Stetson with a friendly grin. \"Ain't likely to forget some of the capers you used to be cutting up. You've filled out considerable. Where have you been for the last ten years? Aunt Sally fretted a lot over you, thinking you was dead or gone to the bad.\"\r\n\r\nLovell's face clouded.\r\n\r\n\"I know I ought to have written,\" he said repentantly, \"but you know I'm a terrible poor scholar, and I'd do most anything than try to write a letter. But where's Uncle Tom and Aunt Sally gone? Surely they ain't dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jonah Stetson slowly, \"no—but I guess they'd rather be. They're in the poorhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"The poorhouse! Aunt Sally in the poorhouse!\" exclaimed Lovell.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and it's a burning shame,\" declared Mrs. Stetson. \"Aunt Sally's just breaking her heart from the disgrace of it. But it didn't seem as if it could be helped. Uncle Tom got so crippled with rheumatism he couldn't work and Aunt Sally was too frail to do anything. They hadn't any relations and there was a mortgage on the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"There wasn't any when I went away.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; they had to borrow money six years ago when Uncle Tom had his first spell of rheumatic fever. This spring it was clear that there was nothing for them but the poorhouse. They went three months ago and terrible hard they took it, especially Aunt Sally, I felt awful about it myself. Jonah and I would have took them if we could, but we just couldn't—we've nothing but Jonah's wages and we have eight children and not a bit of spare room. I go over to see Aunt Sally as often as I can and take her some little thing, but I dunno's she wouldn't rather not see anybody than see them in the poorhouse.\"\r\n\r\nLovell weighed his hat in his hands and frowned over it reflectively.\r\n\r\n\"Who owns the house now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Peter Townley. He held the mortgage. And all the old furniture was sold too, and that most killed Aunt Sally. But do you know what she's fretting over most of all? She and Uncle Tom will have been married fifty years in a fortnight's time and Aunt Sally thinks it's awful to have to spend their golden wedding anniversary in the poorhouse. She talks about it all the time. You're not going, Lovell\"—for Lovell had risen—\"you must stop with us, since your old home is closed up. We'll scare you up a shakedown to sleep on and you're welcome as welcome. I haven't forgot the time you caught Mary Ellen just as she was tumbling into the well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, I'll stay to tea,\" said Lovell, sitting down again, \"but I guess I'll make my headquarters up at the station hotel as long as I stay round here. It's kind of more central.\"\r\n\r\n\"Got on pretty well out west, hey?\" queried Jonah.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty well for a fellow who had nothing but his two hands to depend on when he went out,\" said Lovell cautiously. \"I've only been a labouring man, of course, but I've saved up enough to start a little store when I go back. That's why I came east for a trip now—before I'd be tied down to business. I was hankering to see Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom once more. I'll never forget how kind and good they was to me. There I was, when Dad died, a little sinner of eleven, just heading for destruction. They give me a home and all the schooling I ever had and all the love I ever got. It was Aunt Sally's teachings made as much a man of me as I am. I never forgot 'em and I've tried to live up to 'em.\"\r\n\r\nAfter tea Lovell said he thought he'd stroll up the road and pay Peter Townley a call. Jonah Stetson and his wife looked at each other when he had gone.\r\n\r\n\"Got something in his eye,\" nodded Jonah. \"Him and Peter weren't never much of friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe Aunt Sally's bread is coming back to her after all,\" said his wife. \"People used to be hard on Lovell. But I always liked him and I'm real glad he's turned out so well.\"\r\n\r\nLovell came back to the Stetsons' the next evening. In the interval he had seen Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom. The meeting had been both glad and sad. Lovell had also seen other people.\r\n\r\n\"I've bought Uncle Tom's old house from Peter Townley,\" he said quietly, \"and I want you folks to help me out with my plans. Uncle Tom and Aunt Sally ain't going to spend their golden wedding in the poorhouse—no, sir. They'll spend it in their own home with their old friends about them. But they're not to know anything about it till the very night. Do you s'pose any of the old furniture could be got back?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe every stick of it could,\" said Mrs. Stetson excitedly. \"Most of it was bought by folks living handy and I don't believe one of them would refuse to sell it back. Uncle Tom's old chair is here to begin with—Aunt Sally give me that herself. She said she couldn't bear to have it sold. Mrs. Isaac Appleby at the station bought the set of pink-sprigged china and James Parker bought the grandfather's clock and the whatnot is at the Stanton Grays'.\"\r\n\r\nFor the next fortnight Lovell and Mrs. Stetson did so much travelling round together that Jonah said genially he might as well be a bachelor as far as meals and buttons went. They visited every house where a bit of Aunt Sally's belongings could be found. Very successful they were too, and at the end of their jaunting the interior of the little house behind the apple trees looked very much as it had looked when Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom lived there.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Stetson had been revolving a design in her mind, and one afternoon she did some canvassing on her own account. The next time she saw Lovell she said:\r\n\r\n\"We ain't going to let you do it all. The women folks around here are going to furnish the refreshments for the golden wedding and the girls are going to decorate the house with golden rod.\"\r\n\r\nThe evening of the wedding anniversary came. Everybody in Blair was in the plot, including the matron of the poorhouse. That night Aunt Sally watched the sunset over the hills through bitter tears.\r\n\r\n\"I never thought I'd be celebrating my golden wedding in the poorhouse,\" she sobbed. Uncle Tom put his twisted hand on her shaking old shoulder, but before he could utter any words of comfort Lovell Stevens stood before them.\r\n\r\n\"Just get your bonnet on, Aunt Sally,\" he cried jovially, \"and both of you come along with me. I've got a buggy here for you ... and you might as well say goodbye to this place, for you're not coming back to it any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lovell, oh, what do you mean?\" said Aunt Sally tremulously.\r\n\r\n\"I'll explain what I mean as we drive along. Hurry up—the folks are waiting.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the little old house, it was all aglow with light. Aunt Sally gave a cry as she entered it. All her old household goods were back in their places. There were some new ones too, for Lovell had supplied all that was lacking. The house was full of their old friends and neighbours. Mrs. Stetson welcomed them home again.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tom,\" whispered Aunt Sally, tears of happiness streaming down her old face, \"oh, Tom, isn't God good?\"\r\n\r\nThey had a right royal celebration, and a supper such as the Blair housewives could produce. There were speeches and songs and tales. Lovell kept himself in the background and helped Mrs. Stetson cut cake in the pantry all the evening. But when the guests had gone, he went to Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom, who were sitting by the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Here's a little golden wedding present for you,\" he said awkwardly, putting a purse into Aunt Sally's hand. \"I reckon there's enough there to keep you from ever having to go to the poorhouse again and if not, there'll be more where that comes from when it's done.\"\r\n\r\nThere were twenty-five bright twenty-dollar gold pieces in the purse.\r\n\r\n\"We can't take it, Lovell,\" protested Aunt Sally. \"You can't afford it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you worry about that,\" laughed Lovell. \"Out west men don't think much of a little wad like that.

S'pose I might as well toddle over to Stetsons' and inquire if they haven't disappeared, too.\"\r\n\r\nHe went through the old firs back of the lot and across the field to a rather shabby house beyond. A cheery-faced woman answered his knock and looked at him in a puzzled fashion. \"Have you forgot me, Mrs. Stetson? Don't you remember Lovell Stevens and how you used to give him plum tarts when he'd bring your turkeys home?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stetson caught both his hands in a hearty clasp.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I haven't forgotten!\" she declared. \"Well, well, and you're Lovell! I think I ought to know your face, though you've changed a lot. Fifteen years have made a big difference in you. Come right in. Pa, this is Lovell—you mind Lovell, the boy Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom had for years?\"\r\n\r\n\"Reckon I do,\" drawled Jonah Stetson with a friendly grin. \"Ain't likely to forget some of the capers you used to be cutting up. You've filled out considerable. Where have you been for the last ten years? Aunt Sally fretted a lot over you, thinking you was dead or gone to the bad.\"\r\n\r\nLovell's face clouded.\r\n\r\n\"I know I ought to have written,\" he said repentantly, \"but you know I'm a terrible poor scholar, and I'd do most anything than try to write a letter. But where's Uncle Tom and Aunt Sally gone? Surely they ain't dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jonah Stetson slowly, \"no—but I guess they'd rather be. They're in the poorhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"The poorhouse! Aunt Sally in the poorhouse!\" exclaimed Lovell.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and it's a burning shame,\" declared Mrs. Stetson. \"Aunt Sally's just breaking her heart from the disgrace of it. But it didn't seem as if it could be helped. Uncle Tom got so crippled with rheumatism he couldn't work and Aunt Sally was too frail to do anything. They hadn't any relations and there was a mortgage on the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"There wasn't any when I went away.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; they had to borrow money six years ago when Uncle Tom had his first spell of rheumatic fever. This spring it was clear that there was nothing for them but the poorhouse. They went three months ago and terrible hard they took it, especially Aunt Sally, I felt awful about it myself. Jonah and I would have took them if we could, but we just couldn't—we've nothing but Jonah's wages and we have eight children and not a bit of spare room. I go over to see Aunt Sally as often as I can and take her some little thing, but I dunno's she wouldn't rather not see anybody than see them in the poorhouse.\"\r\n\r\nLovell weighed his hat in his hands and frowned over it reflectively.\r\n\r\n\"Who owns the house now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Peter Townley. He held the mortgage. And all the old furniture was sold too, and that most killed Aunt Sally. But do you know what she's fretting over most of all? She and Uncle Tom will have been married fifty years in a fortnight's time and Aunt Sally thinks it's awful to have to spend their golden wedding anniversary in the poorhouse. She talks about it all the time. You're not going, Lovell\"—for Lovell had risen—\"you must stop with us, since your old home is closed up. We'll scare you up a shakedown to sleep on and you're welcome as welcome. I haven't forgot the time you caught Mary Ellen just as she was tumbling into the well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, I'll stay to tea,\" said Lovell, sitting down again, \"but I guess I'll make my headquarters up at the station hotel as long as I stay round here. It's kind of more central.\"\r\n\r\n\"Got on pretty well out west, hey?\" queried Jonah.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty well for a fellow who had nothing but his two hands to depend on when he went out,\" said Lovell cautiously. \"I've only been a labouring man, of course, but I've saved up enough to start a little store when I go back. That's why I came east for a trip now—before I'd be tied down to business. I was hankering to see Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom once more. I'll never forget how kind and good they was to me. There I was, when Dad died, a little sinner of eleven, just heading for destruction. They give me a home and all the schooling I ever had and all the love I ever got. It was Aunt Sally's teachings made as much a man of me as I am. I never forgot 'em and I've tried to live up to 'em.\"\r\n\r\nAfter tea Lovell said he thought he'd stroll up the road and pay Peter Townley a call. Jonah Stetson and his wife looked at each other when he had gone.\r\n\r\n\"Got something in his eye,\" nodded Jonah. \"Him and Peter weren't never much of friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe Aunt Sally's bread is coming back to her after all,\" said his wife. \"People used to be hard on Lovell. But I always liked him and I'm real glad he's turned out so well.\"\r\n\r\nLovell came back to the Stetsons' the next evening. In the interval he had seen Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom. The meeting had been both glad and sad. Lovell had also seen other people.\r\n\r\n\"I've bought Uncle Tom's old house from Peter Townley,\" he said quietly, \"and I want you folks to help me out with my plans. Uncle Tom and Aunt Sally ain't going to spend their golden wedding in the poorhouse—no, sir. They'll spend it in their own home with their old friends about them. But they're not to know anything about it till the very night. Do you s'pose any of the old furniture could be got back?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe every stick of it could,\" said Mrs. Stetson excitedly. \"Most of it was bought by folks living handy and I don't believe one of them would refuse to sell it back. Uncle Tom's old chair is here to begin with—Aunt Sally give me that herself. She said she couldn't bear to have it sold. Mrs. Isaac Appleby at the station bought the set of pink-sprigged china and James Parker bought the grandfather's clock and the whatnot is at the Stanton Grays'.\"\r\n\r\nFor the next fortnight Lovell and Mrs. Stetson did so much travelling round together that Jonah said genially he might as well be a bachelor as far as meals and buttons went. They visited every house where a bit of Aunt Sally's belongings could be found. Very successful they were too, and at the end of their jaunting the interior of the little house behind the apple trees looked very much as it had looked when Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom lived there.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Stetson had been revolving a design in her mind, and one afternoon she did some canvassing on her own account. The next time she saw Lovell she said:\r\n\r\n\"We ain't going to let you do it all. The women folks around here are going to furnish the refreshments for the golden wedding and the girls are going to decorate the house with golden rod.\"\r\n\r\nThe evening of the wedding anniversary came. Everybody in Blair was in the plot, including the matron of the poorhouse. That night Aunt Sally watched the sunset over the hills through bitter tears.\r\n\r\n\"I never thought I'd be celebrating my golden wedding in the poorhouse,\" she sobbed. Uncle Tom put his twisted hand on her shaking old shoulder, but before he could utter any words of comfort Lovell Stevens stood before them.\r\n\r\n\"Just get your bonnet on, Aunt Sally,\" he cried jovially, \"and both of you come along with me. I've got a buggy here for you ... and you might as well say goodbye to this place, for you're not coming back to it any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lovell, oh, what do you mean?\" said Aunt Sally tremulously.\r\n\r\n\"I'll explain what I mean as we drive along. Hurry up—the folks are waiting.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the little old house, it was all aglow with light. Aunt Sally gave a cry as she entered it. All her old household goods were back in their places. There were some new ones too, for Lovell had supplied all that was lacking. The house was full of their old friends and neighbours. Mrs. Stetson welcomed them home again.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tom,\" whispered Aunt Sally, tears of happiness streaming down her old face, \"oh, Tom, isn't God good?\"\r\n\r\nThey had a right royal celebration, and a supper such as the Blair housewives could produce. There were speeches and songs and tales. Lovell kept himself in the background and helped Mrs. Stetson cut cake in the pantry all the evening. But when the guests had gone, he went to Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom, who were sitting by the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Here's a little golden wedding present for you,\" he said awkwardly, putting a purse into Aunt Sally's hand. \"I reckon there's enough there to keep you from ever having to go to the poorhouse again and if not, there'll be more where that comes from when it's done.\"\r\n\r\nThere were twenty-five bright twenty-dollar gold pieces in the purse.\r\n\r\n\"We can't take it, Lovell,\" protested Aunt Sally. \"You can't afford it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you worry about that,\" laughed Lovell. \"Out west men don't think much of a little wad like that. I owe you far more than can be paid in cash, Aunt Sally. You must take it—I want to know there's a little home here for me and two kind hearts in it, no matter where I roam.\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, Lovell,\" said Uncle Tom huskily. \"You don't know what you've done for Sally and me.\"\r\n\r\nThat night, when Lovell went to the little bedroom off the parlour—for Aunt Sally, rejoicing in the fact that she was again mistress of a spare room, would not hear of his going to the station hotel—he gazed at his reflection in the gilt-framed mirror soberly.\r\n\r\n\"You've just got enough left to pay your passage back west, old fellow,\" he said, \"and then it's begin all over again just where you begun before. But Aunt Sally's face was worth it all—yes, sir. And you've got your two hands still and an old couple's prayers and blessings. Not such a bad capital, Lovell, not such a bad capital.\""}

This was why the young man who opened the sagging gate could not see that it was boarded up, and did not cease his cheerful whistling until he had pressed through the crowding trees and found himself almost on the sunken stone doorstep over which in olden days honeysuckle had been wont to arch. Now only a few straggling, uncared-for vines clung forlornly to the shingles, and the windows were, as has been said, all boarded up.\r\n\r\nThe whistle died on the young man's lips and an expression of blank astonishment and dismay settled down on his face—a good, kindly, honest face it was, although perhaps it did not betoken any pronounced mental gifts on the part of its owner.\r\n\r\n\"What can have happened?\" he said to himself. \"Uncle Tom and Aunt Sally can't be dead—I'd have seen their deaths in the paper if they was.
